<Architect> done!

B31-A23-C86-1523475614952
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this is an elaborate one.
<Builder> let's do it
<Architect> start with four blocks laid in a row in the center
<Builder> does it matter what color?
<Architect> sorry purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> the final product will look like a butterfly. this is its body
<Architect> next, blue blocks
<Builder> got it
<Architect> we are making antennae. from on of the end purple blocks, place a blue block on the corner.
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> not quite
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> sorry. it should be flat
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> one closer to you
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> on that same diagonal, place another blue block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> perfect. now do that on the other side.
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> nailed it
<Architect> so the rest of the blocks are orange.
<Builder> okay
<Architect> one second
<Architect> so this is our base. i didn't realize it was floating. copy each block up one, and then remove the ones on the plate
<Architect> aka shift the design up into the air.

<Builder> done
<Architect> okay. orange blocks next
<Builder> got it
<Architect> the blue is the head of the butterfly
<Builder> okay
<Architect> so on block down from the purple head, place two orange blocks on the sides of the butterfly body
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> we are going up at an angle. so bear with me.
<Architect> on a side of it, place another orange block going outward
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> perfect!
<Builder> same on the other one?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> if its mirrored you could describe one side and I'll fill in the other
<Architect> so add one block on both sides of the upper orange block along the same direction as the body.
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> it is mirrored
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> is that right?
<Architect> add another block same row, towards the head as well. yes that is correct
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> perfect.
<Architect> you will be doing the same thing but instead of a row of three, a row of five. one diagonal upwards like before

<Architect> almost done. we will need to remove the middle block of the orange row with three in it.
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> yes
<Architect> let me check the design to make sure we have this right
<Builder> okay
<Architect> done!

B31-A23-C88-1523476504269
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
<Builder> nice
<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
<Builder> got it
<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.

<Architect> perfect
<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
<Builder> okay
<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
<Builder> correct
<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
<Architect> this is on the left side

[Builder picks up a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
<Architect> that side though,
<Builder> what side?
<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3]
<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
<Builder> *orange
<Architect> left side
<Builder> this side?
<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
<Builder> okay
<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> okay
<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
<Architect> put one block on top of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
<Builder> okay
<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> place one on top of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> hecl
<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
<Builder> which direction should it be
<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
<Builder> no worries
<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-3]

<Builder> wait
<Builder> where?
<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> there
<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction

<Builder> okay
<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> so I'm starting here?
<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> add another to the left side of the last block you placed, and one below it.
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> replace the one you jsut removed
<Builder> which one was that, i don't remember
<Architect> place a blue block right above the floating diagonal block you just placed.
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Builder> okay
<Architect> on the third row, remove the bottom two blocks.
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> got it
<Architect> looks good to me! i think we are done let me check
<Architect> done!

B31-A23-C87-1523478701662
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> I
<Architect> am back
<Builder> hello
<Architect> so this is only orange
<Builder> got it
<Architect> go to the middle of a side, and place a block one row inward
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> place one inward on the side of that block.
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> yes
<Architect> place one on top of that,
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> we are making another stair case
<Architect> one on the side of that block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> one on top
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> and one outward from that top block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> that part is done. three more blocks
<Architect> 4 more
<Builder> okay
<Architect> so they are all floating.
<Builder> where?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> no not quite theres none there. The keyboard on the laptop is slow so bear with me
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> okay, I'll wait
<Architect> stand on the stair top and look foward
<Builder> which way is forward?
<Architect> if you were going up the stairs
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> so the first block will be floating one above the plate, and one away fron the stair case, in the same row as the staircase.
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> this is the same row you are looking down
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> there?
<Architect> put on on the front of that block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> and remove the block in front of you
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yes
<Architect> the next block is in the same row
<Builder> this row?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> okay
<Architect> it is two in the air, and two spaces in front of you.

[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> purple on top
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> on the side you are on

<Architect> stop
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> okay
<Builder> not one diagonal longer?
<Architect> no that is perfect, but i make the green too short.

<Architect> yes, and the purpe x on top, still with the longer diagonals.
<Builder> move the purple up two blocks as well?
<Architect> yes. sorry.
<Architect> looking at it at the wrong angle
<Builder> is the purple sitting on top of the top green block or is it in front, on a different plane?

<Architect> We are done!

B38-A21-C81-1523486576326
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> Hello
<Architect> hello!
<Builder> So are we ready to start?
<Architect> ye
<Builder> Ok, what's first?
<Architect> first, you're gonna wanna place down 4 orange blocks in a square
<Builder> Is everything ok?
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> they should be 3 spaces apart from each other
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> exactly
<Builder> Cool
<Architect> next, place a yellow block diagonally inward from each block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> Ok
<Builder> What's in the center?
<Architect> now place another yellow block on top of each of those
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> Does it follow the same pattern?
<Architect> ok now, on top of that yellow block you just made, place a red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> Cool
<Architect> then delete the yellow block in the middle
<Builder> The one under the red block?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> Ok, I did that. Is there anything else?
<Architect> now you're gonna do the same pattern with the yellow blocks but above the red block
<Builder> Are we going to repeat this bottom bit?
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> so each is gonna be diagonal from the red block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]

B25-A10-C84-1523486756992
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> So the overall structure looks liek a trident.
<Architect> the base starts with two blocks on top of each other
<Builder> which color?
<Architect> blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]

B38-A21-C80-1523486971069
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> Hello!
<Architect> we good to go?
<Builder> Yup
<Architect> cool
<Architect> this one is a little complicated
<Builder> Ooh,
<Builder> What's first?
<Architect> so, two spaces from the side, place 2 blue blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> On top of each other or like that?
<Architect> like that
<Builder> Cool
<Architect> then we're gonna want another blue block diagonally upward from that last block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> yeah like that
<Builder> and next?
<Architect> then another one just like that

[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> Will we repeat that again?
<Architect> nope
<Architect> now behind that last blue block, place a row of 3 blue blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]

<Architect> the first block you place was good
<Builder> Like this?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> just reverse the row so that its protruding out
<Architect> so to the left
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> parallel to the first row of diagonal blocks
<Builder> Ah, should it be going to my left or my right?
<Architect> left
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Builder> Going up this time?
<Architect> not yet
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> then to the left, another orange block

<Architect> nope
<Builder> Pk
<Builder> Ok*
<Architect> on top of the topmost red block, place two yellow blocks going up
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:1]
<Builder> Is this a running guy?
<Architect> and then remove the first yellow block
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> i think so
<Builder> Ok
<Builder> What's next?
<Architect> that should be it, let me just double check
<Builder> Ok
<Architect> yeah its good!
<Builder> Ok, cool

B25-A10-C85-1523487049531
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> So this one is all vertical again
<Architect> the footprint is 5x1
<Builder> 2d?
<Architect> 5x1 by 5up
<Builder> ok
<Architect> start with 4 red blocks
<Architect> stacked vertically
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> 4 red blocks
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> oops
<Architect> then put one yellow on top of that
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> then put two yellows on each side of the topmost red block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> yep
<Architect> finally, to complete the arrow shape, place a yellow on each edge of the yellow you just put down
<Builder> hmmm how do you mean
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?

[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah, like that, but the other direction. like the down edge
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yeah, thats right!
<Builder> nice

B25-A10-C87-1523487347683
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes
<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
<Builder> what color
<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]

<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.

<Builder> like that?
<Architect> get rid of the very bottom orange
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay. now move to the grid space on the ground that is two to the right of that.
<Architect> you can create a similar stack where the floating blocks are 3 above the ground and 5 above the ground
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]

<Architect> idk i haven't seen it
<Builder> oh ok, is that it?
<Architect> yee

B25-A10-C83-1523488152700
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> okay, so the overall shape kind of looks like a weird table.
<Architect> the shape is over a 2d 5 by 5 grid
<Architect> start with purple blocks in the corners of the 5 by 5 grid

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> okay, so here there are three separate structures. one is a floating 3 by 3 square.
<Architect> it is a vertical 3 by 3 square
<Builder> what color?
<Architect> orange
<Architect> and it's floating only one above the ground
<Builder> how far from the edge should i build it?
<Builder> is it the rightmost or leftmost part of the build
<Architect> centering it should suffice
<Builder> ok

<Architect> cool. so the other two structures are the same, just repeated and translated.
<Architect> all blue blocks
<Builder> how far apart are they, and what colors?
<Builder> ok
<Builder> how many blocks forward or backward?
<Architect> the left one is 4 down from the leftblocks in the square
<Architect> the structures kind of look like diagonal ms
<Architect> "M" s

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> Heyo
<Architect> heyoo
<Builder> So what's the first step?
<Architect> to start off, we're gonna make a hollow square in the center
<Builder> Ok, how big and what color?
<Architect> the empty space should be 9 squares
<Architect> yellow
<Builder> Across?
<Architect> nah nah in area
