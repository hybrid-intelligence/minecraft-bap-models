	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block

	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?

	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay

	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block

	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay

	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block

	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there

	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction

	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks

	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks

	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there

	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?

	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part

	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three

	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one

	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
	<Architect> remove top block

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction

	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
	<Architect> remove top block
	<Architect> add one to the left side of the top block and a block below that one

	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
	<Architect> remove top block
	<Architect> add one to the left side of the top block and a block below that one
	<Architect> add another to the left side of the last block you placed, and one below it.

	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
	<Architect> remove top block
	<Architect> add one to the left side of the top block and a block below that one
	<Architect> add another to the left side of the last block you placed, and one below it.
	<Builder> like that?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
	<Architect> remove top block
	<Architect> add one to the left side of the top block and a block below that one
	<Architect> add another to the left side of the last block you placed, and one below it.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> replace the one you jsut removed

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
	<Architect> remove top block
	<Architect> add one to the left side of the top block and a block below that one
	<Architect> add another to the left side of the last block you placed, and one below it.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> replace the one you jsut removed
	<Builder> which one was that, i don't remember
	<Architect> place a blue block right above the floating diagonal block you just placed.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
	<Architect> remove top block
	<Architect> add one to the left side of the top block and a block below that one
	<Architect> add another to the left side of the last block you placed, and one below it.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> replace the one you jsut removed
	<Builder> which one was that, i don't remember
	<Architect> place a blue block right above the floating diagonal block you just placed.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> on the third row, remove the bottom two blocks.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
	<Architect> remove top block
	<Architect> add one to the left side of the top block and a block below that one
	<Architect> add another to the left side of the last block you placed, and one below it.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> replace the one you jsut removed
	<Builder> which one was that, i don't remember
	<Architect> place a blue block right above the floating diagonal block you just placed.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> on the third row, remove the bottom two blocks.

[Chat Log]
	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> this shape has no recognizable look.
	<Builder> nice
	<Architect> it is also all floating one layer off the ground.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> on one side of the plate, i need a orange 3 x 3 square.
	<Builder> is here okay or is that too close?
	<Architect> oops. it needs to be upright.
	<Architect> perfect
	<Architect> we have two small blue block things next.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> So the block is to your right, right?
	<Builder> correct
	<Architect> three spaces over from the forward end of the orange block, place a blue block
	<Architect> this is on the left side
	<Builder> is that what you meant?
	<Architect> actually put one where you are standing
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> oops you arent in the same place on my screen
	<Builder> okay, I deleted that block
	<Architect> that side though,
	<Builder> what side?
	<Architect> On the broad side of the orange square.
	<Builder> is the blue block that i already put down correct?
	<Architect> no. it needs to be moved to the broad side, closer to the middle of the plate
	<Builder> okay, just give me directions from the organe square
	<Builder> *orange
	<Architect> left side
	<Builder> this side?
	<Architect> left stack. face the broad side of the square.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> perfect. place the block three blocks away from the left stack on this side.
	<Builder> three blocks inbetween them or on the third block moving away from the square?
	<Architect> one space closer to the orange block
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> this looks like a narrow staircase
	<Architect> put one block on top of that
	<Architect> so on the left side of that block (the side that faces where you placed the blue block before)
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> place a blue block on the side of the top block
	<Architect> place one on top of that
	<Architect> hecl
	<Architect> heck. its going the wrong direction
	<Builder> which direction should it be
	<Architect> that was my fault i apologize.
	<Builder> no worries
	<Architect> add three more oranges to the left side of the orange block and take off the right hand stack
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yes. on the right hand side, three blocks over from the right stack like before, place a blue block
	<Builder> wait
	<Builder> where?
	<Architect> on the bottom of the blue staircase, place a block
	<Architect> there
	<Architect> we need to turn that staircase around to face the opposite direction
	<Builder> is that right?
	<Architect> it will need to be shifted right by two blocks
	<Architect> getting there
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> great!
	<Architect> so the first row is the single blue block okay
	<Architect> third row is highest row
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> fisrt row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row add a block on top
	<Architect> second row remove bottom
	<Architect> third row remove bottom
	<Architect> finished with that part
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> we are building an exact copy of that
	<Architect> its going to be four rows away instead of three
	<Architect> and it will be on the left side.
	<Builder> so I'm starting here?
	<Architect> keep that there. we can use it as a reference. correct row, but it will be moved left buy a bit. let me count
	<Architect> build three blocks on top of that one
	<Architect> remove top block
	<Architect> add one to the left side of the top block and a block below that one
	<Architect> add another to the left side of the last block you placed, and one below it.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> replace the one you jsut removed
	<Builder> which one was that, i don't remember
	<Architect> place a blue block right above the floating diagonal block you just placed.
	<Builder> okay
	<Architect> on the third row, remove the bottom two blocks.
	<Builder> got it
	<Architect> looks good to me! i think we are done let me check
	<Architect> done!
