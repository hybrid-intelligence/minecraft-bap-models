	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
	<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
	<Builder> what color
	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
	<Builder> ok

	<Builder> ok

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
	<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
	<Builder> what color
	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like that or on the ground?
	<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
	<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> i can use green to make it easier to check

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
	<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
	<Builder> what color
	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like that or on the ground?
	<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
	<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> i can use green to make it easier to check
	<Architect> not quite. shift all that down vertically by one (which gets rid of the bottom orange)

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
	<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
	<Builder> what color
	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like that or on the ground?
	<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
	<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> i can use green to make it easier to check
	<Architect> not quite. shift all that down vertically by one (which gets rid of the bottom orange)

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
	<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
	<Builder> what color
	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like that or on the ground?
	<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
	<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> i can use green to make it easier to check
	<Architect> not quite. shift all that down vertically by one (which gets rid of the bottom orange)

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
	<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
	<Builder> what color
	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like that or on the ground?
	<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
	<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> i can use green to make it easier to check
	<Architect> not quite. shift all that down vertically by one (which gets rid of the bottom orange)
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> get rid of the very bottom orange

	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
	<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
	<Builder> what color
	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like that or on the ground?
	<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
	<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> i can use green to make it easier to check
	<Architect> not quite. shift all that down vertically by one (which gets rid of the bottom orange)
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> get rid of the very bottom orange
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay. now move to the grid space on the ground that is two to the right of that.
	<Architect> you can create a similar stack where the floating blocks are 3 above the ground and 5 above the ground

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
	<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
	<Builder> what color
	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like that or on the ground?
	<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
	<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> i can use green to make it easier to check
	<Architect> not quite. shift all that down vertically by one (which gets rid of the bottom orange)
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> get rid of the very bottom orange
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay. now move to the grid space on the ground that is two to the right of that.
	<Architect> you can create a similar stack where the floating blocks are 3 above the ground and 5 above the ground

	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like that or on the ground?
	<Architect> on the ground, and one less far away
	<Architect> in the vertical direction above the block you just placed, there are two floating orange blocks. one is right on top of what you just placed. the other is 4 above that.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> i can use green to make it easier to check
	<Architect> not quite. shift all that down vertically by one (which gets rid of the bottom orange)
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> get rid of the very bottom orange
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay. now move to the grid space on the ground that is two to the right of that.
	<Architect> you can create a similar stack where the floating blocks are 3 above the ground and 5 above the ground
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> yea
	<Builder> is this the stack overflow logo

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> so this one doesn't really have an overall shape but there are four floating blocks. I will get to those later.
	<Architect> start at the left edge with two orange blocks
	<Builder> vertical or horizontal?
	<Architect> horizontally placed toward the middle
	<Architect> cool. now, make a stair case of height three with orange. like put two more down, on top of the current, but shifted one to the right
	<Architect> headed the same direction as the first
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> what you had initially before you added the third block was the right structure
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> oh like the tetris piece
	<Architect> yes! now there is another "stair step" on top of that
	<Builder> should I just build the same thing I just did?
	<Architect> yep! that completes the first structure.
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now on to the four floating blocks. they are all separate.
	<Architect> place a block down two spaces right of the edge of the first structure
	<Builder> what color
	<Architect> oh, all orange from here on out
