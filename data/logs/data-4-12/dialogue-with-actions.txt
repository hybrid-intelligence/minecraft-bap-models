B47-A30-C23-1523544822631
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one looks like a bridge
<Architect> it will be 10 block long and 4 blocks wide so make sure to leave enough space
<Architect> start by building a row of 2 red blocks even with the edge at one edge of the base
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:0]

<Builder> the top of the ladder? and how far?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes even with the top row. only one row out
<Architect> just like that
<Architect> now we will build the slide portion. it is purple

<Architect> ok this one is a bunch of interlocking T shapes
<Architect> start in the center of the board and build a standing T that is 3 blocks tall and 3 blocks wide
<Architect> in yellow

<Architect> ok good
<Architect> now on the left end of the top of the T, build a tower of 3 red blocks, starting from the side of the T and going up
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> delete those end pieces
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
<Builder> of he red t?
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> yes
<Architect> those will serve as the top of the T
<Architect> now from where you are standing, build a row of 4 red squares to finsih the red T, but have it go towards the end of the board you are looking towards
<Builder> 4 squares?

[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> no sorry. wrong way
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> have the middle of that row of 3 that you built be the center
<Builder> parallel, or perpendicular to the yellow?
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> this?
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> yes but connect it to the middle of the red tower you built
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> no. delete all of the red besides that tower of 3
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> sorry this is confusing to explain
<Builder> do it block by block
<Architect> ok so the middle of the red row will serve as the middle of the top of the T
<Architect> so on the opposite side of where you are, build a row of 4 out
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:3]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> yes! ok now to the next one
<Architect> now from the opposite side of the yellow T from the red, build one blue square on top of the end yellow
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> yes now in the same direction the red is going, build a row of 3 blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> delete the end. the one you already built was included. sorry
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> now from the middle of that blue row, build it to the ground
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> ok now place on green square on the right inside corner of the blue T
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> yes now build it so its a row of 5 connecting towards the red
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> now build it so its an upside down T
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:3]
<Builder> from this end?
<Builder> and 3 wide, like the rest?
<Architect> no start from the middle of the green row and build upwards

[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> good! now under the farthest out green block, build down 2 yellow blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> and then make that into a 2x3 rectangle perpendicular with the way the green L is facing
