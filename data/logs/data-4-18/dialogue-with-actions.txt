<Architect> hello! this one's pretty easy
<Architect> put a row of 3 blue blocks on the ground anywhere
<Builder> That does sound easy
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and then on one side, stack two more blue blocks
<Architect> so you have an "L" shape
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> Ok, like this?
<Architect> perfect! all done
<Builder> Cool

B53-A15-C135-1524064004995
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> alright, this is harder
<Architect> start with a stack of 5 purple blocks in the middle

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Builder> Now what?
<Architect> cool! extend the top purple block to a row of 5 purple blocks
<Architect> so like an upside down "L"
<Builder> So they should extend to one side, correct?
<Architect> yep!
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]

<Architect> sorry
<Architect> the top block that you just built i meant
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:3]
<Builder> Ok, so this?
<Architect> yeah! and then a block to the left of that
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:2]
<Architect> and remove the 2nd last block you just put down
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:3]
<Architect> okay, now do the same thing upside down on the bottom, so it looks like an arrow head

<Architect> alright, we're building a rainbow of concentric horseshoes
<Builder> Sounds easy enough
<Architect> you'd think!
<Builder> Which color is first?
<Architect> alright, make a hollow 3x3 square of orange blocks in the center
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and then delete one of the middle blocks on any edge
<Builder> Vertical or horizontal?

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> I believe this is what you meant

[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:4]
<Architect> make that into a "c"
<Builder> Facing towards the middle?
<Architect> parallel to the purple one, facing away from you
<Architect> so it should be in the same plane as the purple horeshoe
<Architect> and the open end should be on the opposite end you're currently on
<Builder> Oh I see
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:4]

<Builder> I hope there's also a yellow one
<Builder> GOod
<Architect> in front as in towards the blue blocks
<Architect> so perpendicular
<Builder> And then make a "c" from those?
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3]
<Architect> yeah, that's the tip of the horeshoe

<Architect> perfect! two green blocks on any two corners of the red square
<Architect> adjacent corners*
<Architect> not diagonals
<Builder> Should they be inside the orange ring?
<Architect> yes! same height as the orange ring, and inside it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> okay, from the right one, make a staircase of 4 green blocks total
<Architect> extending in the direction you're currently facing, and upwards
<Builder> I need more information
<Architect> yeah, sorry, i just realized that was unclear
<Builder> Is it a diagonal line?
<Architect> start with a green block on top of the orange one in front of the right green one
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> on the same side as the other green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]

<Builder> I see
<Architect> so the trajectory is forward, up, and left
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> and stop at 3 blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]

<Architect> alright, start with a row of 5 orange ones on the ground
<Architect> any direction
<Architect> near the center preferably
<Builder> I was just about to ask
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> Is this good enough location-wise?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yep!

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> and another in front of it, away from the orange structure
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay, two more rows of yellow blocks just like that, with a 1 tile gap in between
<Architect> it's gonna extend one tile into the gray area, i hope that's okay
<Builder> Oh, so on the ground?
<Architect> yeah, on the ground, parallel to the orange

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> good
<Architect> now blue then purple rows
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]

<Architect> great
<Architect> that's it
<Builder> ok cool

B29-A1-C52-1524079252247
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one is pretty complicated. place four blue blocks each on the corner of a 5x5, build near the corner of the board
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> okay so each of these structures are symmetric,
<Architect> it is a tower of three blue and one orange
<Builder> where?
<Architect> add two more blocks to each blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:4]
<Architect> now add an orange to each blue
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4]
<Architect> okay we will try to connect each of these towers using five orange blocks i.e. diagonally
<Architect> but the middle block floating
<Builder> does it matter which I pair?
<Builder> or are they all connected?
<Architect> its looks symetric so they are all connected so if you look from the top down it kinda looks like an x, but the thing is that the bridge is one step above the top of the oranges
<Builder> oh so they connect across the center?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> the bridge?
<Architect> okay, so first place an orange block next to any of the current tops of the towers
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:4]
<Architect> okay now make a 2x2 going towards the other tower
<Builder> the other behind me? or to my right?
<Architect> to your right the 2x2 is parallel to the ground
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:3]
<Architect> okay so place one orange block on top of the orange block closes to the middle
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:3]
<Architect> okay now delete all of the blocks except the last one you placed and the one on top of the tower
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:4]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> okay
<Architect> so now we have to T type structures next to this
<Architect> build*
<Architect> so starting with green
<Architect> stand on the middle shadow of the orange tower thing
<Architect> now three blocks to your left place a green block there
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> actually one more away
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay make a tower of three
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> now make the top of the T add two greens
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> now add one green three blocks to the left and one block towards you
<Builder> in the air?
<Architect> no on the ground
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> actually one more block to the left
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]

<Architect> so thats the bottom of the T again
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]

<Architect> no its perpendicular
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> great
<Architect> all done
