<Builder> good morning!
<Architect> Hi! We'll be building a lowercase h out of green blocks that is floating a level above the gorund
<Architect> ground*
<Builder> great, sounds good
<Architect> first start by putting two green blocks on the ground, one space apart
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Nice. The left column should be 4 green blocks high
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> the right should be 3 blocks high
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> my fault, the left should have one more block at the top
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
<Builder> no problem!
<Architect> now please add a block to connect the two columns
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> Perfect! Now remove the bottom row of blocks
<Architect> (the bottom two)
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! we'll add a column of 6 yellow blocks to the right of the h
<Architect> there will be a space between the column and the h
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> now add a brick to the left and right of the second to top block of the yellow column
<Architect> it should sort of look like a plus sign at the top of the yellow column
<Builder> also yellow?
<Architect> Yes!
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1]
<Builder> a cross!
<Architect> Great! please remove the yellow block right under the plus sign
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Hi! I think we should start by adding the corners of a purple 5x5 square
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> The corners will be part of columns of height 2
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> Oops, I think you have too many spaces between the corners
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]

[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-4]
<Architect> Then above the purple columns, add the perimeter of a 5x5 red square

<Architect> Good stuff! Now in the middle of the bottom layer, add a yellow brick
<Architect> We made some kind of mix of concentric squares and a table
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> I think the yellow brick should be touching the ground
<Builder> oh okay!
<Architect> Sorry, I didn't clarify that

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> start with orange
<Architect> go to an edge and place a row of 2
<Builder> Along the edge?
<Architect> toward the middle
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> now stack another row of two in a stairstep fashion such that it overhangs by one block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> great
<Architect> do it again
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> okay now a single orange block one blank space away from that
<Architect> still in line with the structure and floating up one space
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> This structure looks fun- nothing will touch the ground!
<Builder> cool!
<Architect> We'll start with a row of 4 purple bricks, a layer above the ground
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! now to the left and right of one of the purple bricks in the middle of the row, add orange bricks
<Architect> Sort of like a floating cross if you viewed it from the sky
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> Great! we'll add a two blue bricks, one space away from the orange bricks and diagonally adjacent to the top of the cross
<Architect> You could think of it as adding a row of blue bricks to the top of the cross and then removing the middle brick
<Builder> in the same layer as the rest of the structure?
<Architect> Yes!
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> We'll do that once more (so the blue bricks are part of a length 2 blue diagonal
<Architect> )
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> great! Now we'll mve up a layer
<Architect> we'll start by making the perimeter of a 3x5 orange rectangle
<Architect> the corners of the rectangle touch the orange bricks onthe second layer
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> so if you looked down from the sky, through the rectangle, you would see the orange-purple-orange part of the seoncd layer
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> maybe an easier way to put it is to add a brick on top of the brick at the top of the cross
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> Sorry! The other side of the purple row

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> Ok! That brick will be part of a row of length 5, perpendicular to the purple row
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> Can you remove the two orange bricks from the middle
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Great! Now we'll add the perimeter of a 7x5 rectangle on top of the 3x5 one (up a layer)
<Builder> what color?
<Architect> Also orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:3]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> The row you're currently building will be the side that has length 7
<Builder> unless i am reading your directions badly, it doesnt seem like we have enough orange to build this?
<Architect> Ok! we'll need to remove some bricks from the second layer anyway, so we might as well do that now!
<Builder> if we are removing parts of this, we can substitute some for purple
<Builder> alright!
<Architect> Please remove the bricks from the 3x5 rectangle that are not the corner bricks
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> And for the 7x5 rectangle, we will only need the sides of length 5
<Architect> not the entire rectangle
<Builder> alright!

<Architect> I think the row on you're right needs to be moved to the right by one space
<Architect> So that it is symmetrical to the left side of the structure
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:3]
<Builder> okay i see!
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3]

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello
<Builder> hey
<Architect> this is a bunch of giant block numbers
<Architect> start with orange and stop waving at me
<Architect> in about the middle build a column five tall

<Architect> then two more to the left of the top to make a 7
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> now a yellow 6
<Architect> the long edge of the 6 aligns with the stem of the 7 and faces right
<Builder> Where does the 6 start?
<Architect> behind the 7 from your perspective
<Builder> Is it directly adjacent?
<Architect> yes directly behind it. touches it

<Builder> hi again!
<Architect> Hello! This structure will start with a column of 5 purple bricks
<Architect> It's all purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> To the right of the top brick, add 4 more purple bricks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Please add one more
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Great! This will be the basis of a right-turn arrow
<Builder> alright!
<Architect> So we'll add a diagonal of two purple bricks above and to the left of the rightmost brick
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> Maybe a better way to put it is, if you look at the middle brick of the top row, we want it to be the middle of a column of 5 bricks
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:7 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> Yes!
<Architect> Now remove every other brick of the column you just added
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> so that there are 3 bricks left, one space apart
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> Nice!
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> You completed my thought

<Builder> oh yes, sorry
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> No problem
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> Now floating above the the back right corner of the purple square, add another purple brick
<Architect> So there will be a space between this brick and the purple square
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> Cool Now behind the brick (relative to your perspective, add another purple brick
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> Great! Now add another brick on top of that one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> So if you look at the 6th layer of the structure (the one that currently has two bricks)
<Architect> We are going to make it into a plus sign
<Architect> where the middle brick of the plus is the one directly underneat the brick you just added
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> That's perfect!

B16-A26-C98-1524155903266
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Ok, this structure will take some space, so I would back up a few steps
<Architect> We'll start with a yellow row of length 4
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> Awesome! Now in front and behind the block you are looking at, add a yellow brick
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> Nice! now we'll add two green bricks diagonal to the top of the cross
<Architect> So that there is a yello-yellow-green diagonal
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Perfect!
<Architect> Now we'll move to the second layer
<Architect> We'll actually make the same cross plus two diagonals twice, but in different places with different colors
<Builder> okay!
<Architect> The first one will be red and orange, where the bottom of the crossis three to the left and one above the top of the yellow cross

<Architect> The next shape we'll make will be purple and blue
<Architect> It will also be on the second layer
<Architect> The blue bricks will 3 in front of and 5 in front of the top of the yellow cross
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Not quite
<Builder> here?
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> You were actually just there
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> Ah wait, ok, that was bad on my part
<Builder> no problem!
<Architect> So the blue bricks will be on the same line as the yellow bricks
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2]

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> Ok! now we will add a red brick for the nose
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> it will be one more spot down
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Great!

B16-A26-C145-1524156923760
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Great! this one will also take the whole map
<Architect> so we will start with a column of 4 red bricks, 3 spots from the right hand side of the map
<Architect> so there will be 2 spaces between the edge of the map and the column
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-3]

<Architect> that's perfect!
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> now remove the brick from the bottom of the column
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> Great! we'll add a brick on the edge of the map on the same level as the top brick of the column
<Builder> right edge?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> totally fine!
<Architect> Perhaps in front of the brick is a better way to put it, so between your avatar and the brick
<Architect> and it will still be red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> so if you turn 90 degrees to your right, that might help with the perspective
<Architect> Can you remove the brick you just added?
[Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Architect> Thanks!
<Builder> yeah sorry! but confusing
<Builder> bit*
<Architect> Ok, so if you turn to your right, that will help with the perspective a bit
<Architect> ok, so to the right of the top of that column, add two red bricks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> the column of red bricks
[Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> don't worry too much about the edge of the map stuff
<Builder> oh okay
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Architect> great! now add a brick on top of the middle brick of that row
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-4]
<Architect> cool! then remove the brick in the middle of that row
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Architect> Awesome! now on the ground, to the right of the red column, add one red brick
<Architect> left, rather
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> and on the left of that, add a column of 5 red bricks, floating a layer off the ground
