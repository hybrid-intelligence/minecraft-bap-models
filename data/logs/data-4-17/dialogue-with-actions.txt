[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> its not a step..
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> on the other side

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello
<Builder> hello
<Architect> put down a column of three orange blocks on one edge
<Architect> vertical
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:5]
<Architect> then two more blocks jutting out from the top and towards you
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]
<Architect> then one block below the one you just placed
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> cool
<Architect> then starting from underneath the last block build a row of three yellow blocks
<Architect> same orientation as the orange structure
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]

<Architect> complete the yellow L with two more blocks
<Architect> vertically
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> now we are going to build a green staircase...
<Architect> the first block should be jutting out from the top of the yellow and in the same orientaton as the current structure
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> then finish the staircase...
<Architect> if that makes sense
<Builder> do the stairs overlap at all or is it just diagonal?
<Builder> like is there a three stack then two stack then one?
<Architect> they can't as it's just one block per step
<Architect> so the next block will be diagonally below and to the right of the green
<Builder> okay, nothing stacked
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
