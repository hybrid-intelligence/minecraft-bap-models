	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left

	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks

	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
	<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
	<Architect> just one block left, a purple block

	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
	<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
	<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
	<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right
	<Architect> above both

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
	<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
	<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
	<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right
	<Architect> above both
	<Architect> yup
	<Architect> wait we built this wrong LOL

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
	<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
	<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
	<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right
	<Architect> above both
	<Architect> yup
	<Architect> wait we built this wrong LOL
	<Architect> let's backtrack
	<Builder> aright
	<Architect> should be easy to fix,
	<Architect> can u go on the other side
	<Architect> it'll be easier to fix from there

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok, this build is 3D
	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
	<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
	<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
	<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right
	<Architect> above both
	<Architect> yup
	<Architect> wait we built this wrong LOL
	<Architect> let's backtrack
	<Builder> aright
	<Architect> should be easy to fix,
	<Architect> can u go on the other side
	<Architect> it'll be easier to fix from there
	<Builder> kk
	<Architect> ok, plane 3
	<Architect> yellow block on the right should be one block forward, yellow block on the left should be one block toward you
	<Architect> so the one on the right should be moved one more block forward, the yellow block on the left should float above the red block

	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done

	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block

	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu

	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
	<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
	<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
	<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right

	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
	<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
	<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
	<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right
	<Architect> above both
	<Architect> yup
	<Architect> wait we built this wrong LOL
	<Architect> let's backtrack
	<Builder> aright
	<Architect> should be easy to fix,
	<Architect> can u go on the other side
	<Architect> it'll be easier to fix from there
	<Builder> kk
	<Architect> ok, plane 3
	<Architect> yellow block on the right should be one block forward, yellow block on the left should be one block toward you
	<Architect> so the one on the right should be moved one more block forward, the yellow block on the left should float above the red block
	<Architect> yup, now move the green block on the right one forward as well, and the left one backward

	<Architect> so we'll keep the plane convention
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square

	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work

	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
	<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
	<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
	<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right
	<Architect> above both
	<Architect> yup
	<Architect> wait we built this wrong LOL
	<Architect> let's backtrack
	<Builder> aright
	<Architect> should be easy to fix,
	<Architect> can u go on the other side
	<Architect> it'll be easier to fix from there
	<Builder> kk
	<Architect> ok, plane 3
	<Architect> yellow block on the right should be one block forward, yellow block on the left should be one block toward you
	<Architect> so the one on the right should be moved one more block forward, the yellow block on the left should float above the red block
	<Architect> yup, now move the green block on the right one forward as well, and the left one backward
	<Architect> yup
	<Architect> and then move the purple one back

	<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
	<Architect> first, put a red block down
	<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
	<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
	<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
	<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
	<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
	<Builder> yeah
	<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
	<Architect> from the one ur looking at
	<Architect> yea that works
	<Architect> so the red block goes there
	<Architect> kk, plane 1 done
	<Builder> lol
	<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block
	<Architect> kk, plane 2 done
	<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange
	<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block
	<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level
	<Architect> kk
	<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick
	<Architect> ok, plane 3 done
	<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left
	<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward
	<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block
	<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad
	<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done
	<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks
	<Builder> forward = going farther from me?
	<Architect> yes
	<Builder> k
	<Architect> facing you meaning towards you
	<Builder> gotchu
	<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you
	<Architect> just a single block
	<Architect> that's just its position
	<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right
	<Architect> yup
	<Builder> my b
	<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right
	<Architect> kk, plane 5 done
	<Architect> just one block left, a purple block
	<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right
	<Architect> above both
	<Architect> yup
	<Architect> wait we built this wrong LOL
	<Architect> let's backtrack
	<Builder> aright
	<Architect> should be easy to fix,
	<Architect> can u go on the other side
	<Architect> it'll be easier to fix from there
	<Builder> kk
	<Architect> ok, plane 3
	<Architect> yellow block on the right should be one block forward, yellow block on the left should be one block toward you
	<Architect> so the one on the right should be moved one more block forward, the yellow block on the left should float above the red block
	<Architect> yup, now move the green block on the right one forward as well, and the left one backward
	<Architect> yup
	<Architect> and then move the purple one back
	<Architect> should share an edge with the blue block on the right
