like 6th column, second row from any side of the square", "<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks", "<Builder> yeah", "<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work", "<Architect> from the one ur looking at", "<Architect> yea that works", "<Architect> so the red block goes there", "<Architect> kk, plane 1 done", "<Builder> lol", "<Architect> plane 2, put an orange block one block up and one block to the right of the red block", "<Architect> kk, plane 2 done", "<Architect> plane 3, put a yellow block one block to the left of the orange", "<Architect> then a yellow block one block forward and one block to the right of the orange block", "<Architect> the yellow blocks should be on the same level", "<Architect> kk", "<Architect> can u go on the other side real quick", "<Architect> ok, plane 3 done", "<Architect> on the yellow block on the left, put a green block one block forward and one block to the left", "<Architect> other way, facing outward from what we've built rather than inward", "<Architect> yup, and then on the other yellow block, put a green block one up and one forward from the yellow block", "<Architect> facing the other way also, my bad", "<Architect> perfect, plane 4 done", "<Architect> next plane again has 2 blue blocks", "<Builder> forward = going farther from me?", "<Architect> yes", "<Builder> k", "<Architect> facing you meaning towards you", "<Builder> gotchu", "<Architect> from the green block on the left, put a blue block one unit to the right, one unit up, and one unit towards you", "<Architect> just a single block", "<Architect> that's just its position", "<Architect> right plane, but two units to the right", "<Architect> yup", "<Builder> my b", "<Architect> and then another blue block one unit up and one unit towards u from the green block on the right", "<Architect> kk, plane 5 done", "<Architect> just one block left, a purple block", "<Architect> it should share an edge with the block on the left and a corner with the block on the right", "<Architect> above both", "<Architect> yup", "<Architect> wait we built this wrong LOL", "<Architect> let's backtrack", "<Builder> aright", "<Architect> should be easy to fix,", "<Architect> can u go on the other side", "<Architect> it'll be easier to fix from there", "<Builder> kk", "<Architect> ok, plane 3", "<Architect> yellow block on the right should be one block forward, yellow block on the left should be one block toward you", "<Architect> so the one on the right should be moved one more block forward, the yellow block on the left should float above the red block", "<Architect> yup, now move the green block on the right one forward as well, and the left one backward", "<Architect> yup", "<Architect> and then move the purple one back", "<Architect> should share an edge with the blue block on the right", "<Architect> we done", "<Builder> sweet", "<Architect> sorry about that, switching sides threw me off at some point i guess"], "Timestamp": "2018-04-06 23:17:22", "BlocksInGrid": [{"PerspectiveCoordinates": {"Y": -0.5624538171259185, "X": 1.584967186962, "Z": 6.493960634303881},
