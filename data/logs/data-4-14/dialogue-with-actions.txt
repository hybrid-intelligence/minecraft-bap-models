<Architect> hi
<Builder> hey
<Architect> so we're going to make a green chair thing
<Builder> ready
<Architect> first, put two green blocks on the ground with a space between them
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> one space?
<Architect> yup, that looks good
<Architect> behind them and in the middle of them, put another green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> it should also have a blank space between these two and it though
<Architect> sorry, wasn't fast enough
<Architect> so move that one you placed backwards a space
<Builder> one more over?
<Architect> yeah
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> nice
<Architect> in the middle of all three of these blocks, on the layer above them, place another green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> like so?
<Architect> yup, exactly
<Architect> now make a 3x3 platform on top of that last block, centered at that block
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> OK
<Architect> cool, that's the seat of the chair
<Architect> the back will be aligned with the row that is aligned with the one-block leg
<Builder> OK
<Architect> and it goes straight up by two blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]

<Builder> OK
<Architect> beautiful :)
<Builder> THANKS

<Architect> hi!
<Architect> not really sure how to describe this one
<Builder> salut
<Architect> close to an edge, start by placing 2 orange blocks with 3 blank spaces between them
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> k
<Architect> on the left block, put another orange block diagonally up and right of it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> do the same for the other block, except going inwards
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> on those two top blocks, put one orange block each going towards you
<Builder> same level?
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> now connect those last two in the middle, such that they make a U shape if you look from above
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> cool, done with orange blocks
<Architect> let's use green
<Architect> on that middle block you just placed, put a green block on the face going towards you, same level
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> wait, can you go back to the perspective you were at before
<Architect> oh okay, this works
<Architect> now, one more green block diagonally towards you and up
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Builder> is this what you meant
<Architect> oh, wait
<Architect> you had it and then removed it
<Architect> it's to the left of the top block you have here
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> yup!
<Builder> i thought you said right for some reason
<Architect> oh haha
<Architect> can you do that one more time
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay cool, we finished one part of the structure
<Architect> can you go behind the structure now
<Architect> so opposite here
<Builder> ready
<Architect> two to the left and three forwards from the bottom left orange block, place a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> correct?
<Architect> i think so!
<Architect> then put another purple diagaonally up and to the right of that one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> diagonally*
<Architect> that's close, but when i said "up" i meant up one layer
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> one more similar looking structure
<Architect> two blocks forward from the top purple block, put a red
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> ok
<Builder> i think
<Architect> yeah! now make the mirror image of the purple structure in red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
<Builder> done!
<Architect> uhh
<Architect> so put the bottom red on the other side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> thats not mirror
<Architect> sorry i'm bad at explaining
<Architect> let me just check that it's right
<Builder> across no centerline is that a mirror
<Architect> across the axis that connects the top purple and red? idk
<Architect> just shifted
<Architect> okay, this looks good
<Builder> looks like a some sea monsters with just their heads poking out of the water
<Architect> i could see that

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello again :)
<Builder> ready player one
<Architect> this one looks annoying
<Architect> it's a bunch of dotted lines
<Architect> going from one edge to the other, make a floating row of green blocks, except that they have one-block gaps in between them
<Architect> it will have 5 blocks total
[Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> are the outer blocks each on an edge?
[Builder picks up a green block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> no, i don't think it matters, as long as there are 5
<Architect> though i need to make sure we left enough space for everything else, one sec
<Architect> we're maybe okay
<Builder> if you say so
<Architect> can you position yourself so that you're at the end of that line, but with the larger amount of blank space to your right?
<Architect> wait jk, you put it in the middle
<Architect> let's shift it all over so that they're three blocks away from the left edge
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3]

[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> cool, sorry that was tedious
<Builder> np
<Architect> from the second green block from the end that's close to you, we'll place a yellow block diagonally on top of and to the right of that block
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]

[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Builder> like so?
<Architect> yes!
<Architect> that's the end of a yellow dotted line consisting of four blocks extending to the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]

[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]
<Architect> very nice
<Architect> directly on top of the second yellow block from the left, put an orange block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> that is the bottom end of an orange dotted line extending away from you, consisting of 3 blocks
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> okay, there's one last dotted line in red made of 3 blocks
<Architect> it starts on the ground and extends up vertically, and starts in the space in front of the end of the orange line
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]

<Architect> hi!
<Architect> this one is a big yellow arch with some stuff going through it, not sure what exactly
<Builder> lets do it
<Architect> near the center of the board, build a yellow arch 6 blocks tall and 5 blocks wide
<Builder> like an upside down u
<Builder> or like the st louis arch
<Architect> i don't know what the st louis arch looks like tbh
<Builder> ..
<Architect> it's a U without rounded edges
<Architect> sorry haha
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> wait
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> should be one taller
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> cool
<Builder> arc de triumph
<Architect> if you say so
<Architect> on one side of the arch, in the middle, put a red block
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> uhhh okay sorry i wasn't clear enough
<Architect> it's on the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay, let's keep this perspective
<Architect> on top of it and to its left, place one red block each
<Builder> each what
<Architect> one red block
<Architect> ?
<Architect> each
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> or this
<Architect> this is right
<Architect> now put one more red block one block towards you and one block to the right of the corner of that L shape
<Architect> backwards L, rather
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> uhh
<Architect> remove the first block you placed, but keep the second
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> ok, so from that second one, make another diagonal red block
<Architect> so that it comes towards you and to the right by one block each
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> now put one more red block on the last block you placed, on its face that is towards you
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> cool
<Architect> now for the other side
<Architect> on the top red block, put one orange block on the side that's facing you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> now we're going to make two other orange blocks extend diagonally left and towards you from this first one
<Architect> does that make sense?
<Builder> maybe
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> oops that's really close
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> i forgot to say they also go up
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> yes!
<Architect> cool, looks good

B49-A39-C55-1523767968053
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello again
<Builder> ready
<Architect> this one has a lot of diagonals again
<Architect> go to the center of an edge
<Builder> on the ground?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> we'll first make a yellow v-shape on the ground
<Architect> start by placing a yellow block where you are
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> then, diagonally left and right but staying on the ground, place two more yellow blocks on each side to make a V
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes, but once more
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> no, sorry
<Architect> the thing makes a large V
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay, on the ground in front of each of the tips of the V, place an orange block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> oops sorry, I meant behind :)
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> so these are each going to be the starting step of a staircase going upwards
<Architect> we can just start on the left side for now, and you can do the same on the right side
<Architect> so you'll want two more orange blocks going diagonally up and away from the first orange block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> looks good. do the same for the other side
<Builder> more on the left?
<Architect> nope, that's it
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay, on the ends of those top orange blocks, facing away from you, put a red block on each
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now, we're going to make the same V-shape that's on the ground in yellow, but using red and it will be standing up to meet those two red blocks we placed
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> cool shape
<Architect> yup! and lastly, make an upside-down V in red that also uses those blocks as the ends
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]

[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> done i think
<Architect> we did it!

B49-A39-C10-1523768489600
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello
<Architect> this one is kind of like a rainbow using three colors
<Architect> it stands up, and all blocks lie within the same plane
<Builder> ready
<Architect> on two edges, along the same row, place a red block at each end
[Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> now put a purple block to the right of the left red block, leaving a one block gap
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> wait sorry, that purple should be on the ground
<Builder> i thought you said it stands up
<Architect> yeah, it will
<Architect> patience!
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> do the same thing on the right side
<Architect> but going inwards
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay, now using the same technique, place yellow blocks relative to those purple blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> cool
<Architect> now think of these as the bases of three separate arches
<Architect> in those colors
<Builder> i see
<Architect> let's start simple with yellow
<Architect> put a yellow block on the next layer up and between those on the ground
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]

[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> that finishes the yellow arch
<Architect> now for purple
<Architect> on the left purple block, put one purple block diagonally up and right of it
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> this whole shape is symmetric, so you can do the same for the other side
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> now connect those two top purple blocks in the middle, on the same level
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> we'll do a similar pattern for the red blocks, except now there will be four blocks going up diagonally instead of three
<Builder> connected at the top in the same layer?

<Builder> done
<Architect> cool! that's our rainbow
<Architect> sort of
<Builder> its not right?
<Architect> no it's right, it's just not really a rainbow :P
<Builder> oh gotcha

B49-A39-C106-1523768948389
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> okay
<Architect> sorry, hi, first of all
<Architect> let's start near the center of the board
<Builder> on the ground?
<Architect> there's only going to be one block on the ground
<Architect> everything else extends up from that
<Architect> make it a red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> this is going to be the base of a T shape
<Architect> three high, three wide
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> let's start with the left side of this T since it's simpler
<Architect> build another red block diagonally up and left from the left end of the T. it should lie on the same plane
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> do this one more time but with a green block
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> that looked rough but you got it
<Architect> okay, now for the right side
<Architect> on top of the right end of the T, place two more red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> directly to the right of those two you just placed, place green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> place another red block on top of that top green block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> diagonally up and right of that top red block, place a green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> extending out from the bottom green block on the right, place two green blocks
<Builder> this one?
<Architect> i think so, it's a little hard for me to tell what you're exactly looking at
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> no no, to the right of it
<Architect> still on the same plane as everything else
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> yup!
<Architect> okay, we are done with this plane. there are a few more blocks on the planes directly in front of and behind all this stuff
<Builder> ready
<Architect> directly in front of the bottom left two green blocks, put green blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> oops
<Architect> the second one isn't right
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> put it along that bottom row
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> my bad
<Architect> wait
<Architect> you removed the one that was correct
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> not quite
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> it's to the right of that newest green block
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah!
<Architect> okay now go over to the other side of this thing
<Architect> you see how there's a row of three green blocks here on the left?
<Builder> yeah
<Architect> we're going to put one last green block on the middle of that row, towards you
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> got it
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> let me check that everything is right
<Architect> cool looks good!

B49-A39-C79-1523769585238
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hi!
<Builder> hi
<Architect> this entire thing floats in the air and consists of cross shaped structures
<Architect> start at an edge in the middle and place two green blocks stacked on top of each other
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-5]
<Architect> actually, make that 4
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Architect> remove the bottom one
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> on the left and right sides of the middle block, place another green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-5]
<Architect> on the back side of that middle green block, put a yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Architect> extend that to make a row of 5 blocks coming towards you
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> this is part of a 5x5 yellow cross, so you can fill in the rest
<Builder> i thought you said it was floating
<Architect> oh, yeah
<Architect> the sides go out to the left and right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> it's a centered cross when looking top down
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok i think
<Architect> looks good
<Architect> at the end of that yellow cross that's closest to you right now, put an orange block towards you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> then put a blue block to the left of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> the blue block is the right end of a cross that looks exactly like the green one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> the orange block is going to be part of the only cross that isn't centered
<Architect> so more of a holy cross i guess?
<Architect> put another three oranges to its right
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> on the second to rightmost orange block, we'll put one block on each of its sides, such that it is laying flat like the yellow cross
<Builder> orange?
<Architect> yup
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> beautiful
<Architect> we've finished the cross montage
<Builder> nice!

B49-A39-C107-1523770013466
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one kind of looks like a person standing up but also at the same time not exactly so
<Builder> uh huh
<Architect> also, everything stands up and lies on the same plane
<Architect> start near the middle
<Architect> place a two stack block of red and a two stack block of orange such that there is a 2-block gap between them
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> i totally meant "two block stack" not "two stack block"
<Architect> i'm bad
<Architect> but you got me
<Builder> yeah
<Builder> i didnt even notice
<Architect> haha
<Architect> alright, now diagonally up and right from the top red block, place another red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> this red is the bottom left corner of a 2x2 square that follows a checkerboard pattern of red and orange blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> cool
<Architect> nice
<Architect> diagonally up and left from that top orange block, place another orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> make it a 2-stack of orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> do the same on the other side but with red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> on the top orange block, place a row of 2 yellow blocks to its left
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2]
<Architect> sorry, the yellow should be adjacent to the orange's left face
<Builder> oh you said on
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2]
<Architect> yeah, sorry
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
<Architect> do the same again for the other side
<Builder> yellow?
<Architect> yup!
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:4]
<Architect> finally, we're going to make another of those checkerboard 2x2 things between the tops of the orange and red stacks
<Architect> it will be one level up
<Architect> and the checkerboard colors will be reversed
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
<Builder> done
<Architect> nice!
<Architect> so is it a person?
<Builder> oh yeah
<Architect> but there's like a huge hole in him
<Architect> oh well
