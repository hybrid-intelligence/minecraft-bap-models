	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh

	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh

	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side

	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side

	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks

	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have

	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong

	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction

	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference

	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
	<Builder> ya
	<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
	<Builder> ooooo

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
	<Builder> ya
	<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward

	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
	<Builder> ya
	<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
	<Builder> ooooo

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
	<Builder> ya
	<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
	<Builder> ooooo
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> okay last step
	<Builder> ok

	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
	<Builder> ya
	<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
	<Builder> ooooo
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> okay last step
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> use red
	<Architect> go to reference but floating at the top

	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
	<Builder> ya
	<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
	<Builder> ooooo
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> okay last step
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> use red
	<Architect> go to reference but floating at the top
	<Architect> on the tallest yellow column, place a red block above it, but in front of it
	<Architect> so it's like floating

	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
	<Builder> ya
	<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
	<Builder> ooooo
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> okay last step
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> use red
	<Architect> go to reference but floating at the top
	<Architect> on the tallest yellow column, place a red block above it, but in front of it
	<Architect> so it's like floating

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> hi
	<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
	<Builder> :((((( okkk
	<Architect> start in the center
	<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
	<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
	<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
	<Architect> that was in front of you
	<Builder> o sorry
	<Architect> other way
	<Builder> here?
	<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
	<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
	<Architect> get on the ground
	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
	<Builder> ya
	<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
	<Builder> ooooo
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> okay last step
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> use red
	<Architect> go to reference but floating at the top
	<Architect> on the tallest yellow column, place a red block above it, but in front of it
	<Architect> so it's like floating
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> loks like a banana doing a handstand

	<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
	<Builder> good?
	<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
	<Builder> in yellow?
	<Architect> in blue
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
	<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
	<Architect> good
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay now go back to reference
	<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
	<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
	<Architect> and build 4 high.
	<Architect> in yellow
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> place 2 more blocks
	<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
	<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
	<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
	<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
	<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
	<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> place in front of that yellow
	<Architect> should be building toward u
	<Architect> yeah
	<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
	<Architect> does that make sense?
	<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
	<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
	<Builder> ooooh
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> I was wrong
	<Architect> keep what u have
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
	<Architect> move back
	<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
	<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
	<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
	<Architect> then delete
	<Architect> other way
	<Architect> same idea, but other direction
	<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
	<Architect> go back to reference
	<Architect> float back to the top
	<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
	<Builder> ya
	<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
	<Builder> ooooo
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> okay last step
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> use red
	<Architect> go to reference but floating at the top
	<Architect> on the tallest yellow column, place a red block above it, but in front of it
	<Architect> so it's like floating
	<Architect> yeah
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> loks like a banana doing a handstand
	<Builder> omg
	<Architect> we're done
