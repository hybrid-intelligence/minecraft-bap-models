<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello. ready
<Architect> hello!
<Architect> okay, so it looks like we're building an X shaped thing
<Architect> start by putting an orange block near the middle of the grid
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and stack another one on top
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> then remove the bottom one
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> alright, put one orange block on both sides of the current one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> then extend each side by one orange block towards you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yep! now from each of those, build outward again
<Architect> to the sides
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> and repeat that pattern again on each side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> and one more off each side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> oops, one block too many. get rid of the last one you put down on each side
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay, now, delete the second block from the left on the left side
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> yep! and delete the third block from the left on the left side, so you have a diagonal line from the row of 3
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now make the right side mirror the left. so delete the same two blocks
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay, cool! now stack a row of 3 red blocks on top of the row of 3 orange
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> and now delete the first row of red that you put down
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> good! almost done!
<Architect> on top of the ends of the row of red blocks, place one more red block each
<Builder> do I repeat the thing I did with orange but on red?
<Architect> no, it's a little different
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]
<Architect> sorry, i meant on top, so stack them
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> good! and now extend those one block outwards on either side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> okay, now delete the two on top of the bottom row
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]

<Architect> other direction
<Architect> yup
<Builder> here?
<Architect> okay move 1 block to the right
<Builder> which direction am i facing for you right now?
<Architect> go back 1
<Architect> that was my forward
<Builder> ok
<Architect> our coordinates are lined up
<Architect> move to the right
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> okay build 4 blocks
<Builder> vertically or horizontal?

<Architect> horizontal
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> like this
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now do the same thing 1 block to the right of that 1
<Builder> am i facing your forward or your right right now?
<Architect> so there should be a space between the two columns
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> okay now move 1 block forward
<Architect> in the gap above the two columns
<Architect> place a purple block above the empty space
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> it should be above the orange block
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> 1 second I'm going to rephrase it
<Builder> or do you want me to connect the columns
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> connect the columns
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> do that for the block underneath that 1
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> so 2 blocks
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> in each empty space
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like filling in the gaps?
<Architect> remove the last 2 blocks u placed
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> okay now build vertically in the Z direction
<Architect> those 2 purple blocks should be floating above
<Architect> its not all flat
<Builder> oh ok
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> like that
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> do the same for the other 1
<Builder> ok
<Architect> but yeah
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> good?
<Architect> yeah but that 2nd purple column should have 1 more block
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> there's 3 blocks in that column. delete the one underneath
<Architect> I think you double place
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> ok good
<Builder> o sorry
<Architect> no worries
<Architect> oka so now move to the other empty column
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now using yellow
<Architect> place 2 blocks in the empty space. 1 block should connect the orange columns and the other should be just underneath them
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> no
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> so you know how you're facing the bottom of the columns
<Builder> o ok
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ok cool
<Architect> okay now do that again but to the right of the orange column
<Architect> also don't keep moving your cam, it messes our reference
<Architect> not there, other side
<Builder> o sorry
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yeah
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> okay now do that again to the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> should like the 3 orange columns
<Builder> like this?
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> to the right 1 more space
<Builder> my right?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> 1 more
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> no 1 more to the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> do the same thing, but 1 more row to the right
<Builder> same thing as the yellow blocks or orange blocks?
<Architect> there should be a space between the last yellow column you made and the next yellow 1 you will make
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay now similar to what we did with the purple
<Architect> use blue and place them vertical in the empty space between the yellow. 1 block should be on the bottom of the yellow, and 1 should hang
<Architect> dont move
<Builder> ok
<Architect> so from where you're standing
<Architect> the blocks in front of you building up should be: empty space, blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yes
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now build 1 block in front of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?

[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> now move back diagonally
<Architect> other way
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ok
<Architect> there should be a green block above the orange gap
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> do the same thing 1 more time but 1 level higher
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> nah, but like the same pattern
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> see how the gren blocks are place diagonally back
<Builder> ooooo
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:3]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now go to the other corner of the red
<Builder> which corner
<Architect> like the 1 in front of u
<Builder> this one?
<Architect> yeah so stand on taht red corner
<Architect> place a block there
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> look forward
<Architect> turn 90 degrees
<Architect> left
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> is this your forward?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place a green block on the orange block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> now this 1 will look like a staircase
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3]
<Architect> do what we did 2 tims
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> 1 more
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> that was right
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:3]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> i think that's it
<Builder> nice!
<Architect> I'm going to check
<Builder> ok
<Architect> we're done
<Builder> nice!

B36-A35-C141-1523919296154
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> lol this is gonna be pretty hard
<Builder> :((((( okkk
<Architect> start in the center
<Architect> move likr 4 blocks back
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now for all intents and purposes, if I tell you to reset your view, come to this spot
<Architect> the angles on this 1 are weird
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place 1 yellow block infront of you
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> and then 2 more vertically behind that
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> that was in front of you
<Builder> o sorry
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> other way
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> delete that last block, and place it ontop of the 2nd block
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> the second yellow column should be 2 high
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now move to the empty space infront of the yellow thing u just built
<Architect> get on the ground
<Architect> to your immediate right, imitate what you just built but in blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> close, delete the 2 block high column
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> closer, but move the 2nd block to the other 1
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> good?
<Architect> now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built
<Builder> in yellow?
<Architect> in blue
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built
<Architect> it should look like floating stairs
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> good
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay now go back to reference
<Architect> it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana
<Architect> to build the body, go to the empty space between the yellow and blue
<Architect> and build 4 high.
<Architect> in yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> place 2 more blocks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> delete the bottom 2 on the ground
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> okay so from your view point right now, add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing
<Architect> add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made
<Architect> then delete the topmost block you placed
<Builder> add 3 yellow blocks in which direction?
<Architect> so you're facing the yellow column
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place in front of that yellow
<Architect> should be building toward u
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now to the right of the last yellow block you placed, put a purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah, basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped
<Architect> does that make sense?
<Architect> so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed
<Architect> and then 1 to the right of that
<Builder> ooooh
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> do the same thing on the other side
<Builder> ok
<Architect> yeah
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> I was wrong
<Architect> keep what u have
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay add a block to the front of the 1 u just placed. it should be building toward u
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> delete the old block u built from, should look diagonal
<Builder> ok
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> rotate 180 degrees
<Architect> move back
<Architect> and then go left towards the other purple leg
<Architect> do the same thing you just did, but from this reference
<Architect> place the block in front of the old 1
<Architect> then delete
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> other way
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> same idea, but other direction
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> nope, reset it to what it was,
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2]
<Architect> go back to reference
<Architect> float back to the top
<Architect> see how the 1 leg we finished goes diagonal back
<Builder> ya
<Architect> make the other 1 go diagonal forward
<Builder> ooooo
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> okay last step
<Builder> ok
<Architect> use red
<Architect> go to reference but floating at the top
<Architect> on the tallest yellow column, place a red block above it, but in front of it
<Architect> so it's like floating
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> ok
<Architect> loks like a banana doing a handstand
<Builder> omg
<Architect> we're done

B36-A35-C143-1523920494316
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> lol this 1 is harder than the other 1, we have to make a flower
<Builder> ooookkkk
<Architect> go to the center
<Architect> that's good
<Architect> go left like 3 blocks
<Architect> rotate right 90 degrees
<Architect> this is reference
<Builder> ok
<Architect> build a column 4 high of green blocks
<Architect> in front of you
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> delete the lowest block
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> now in front of the colum you just made, add 1 green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> it should be on the ground
<Builder> o ok
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> okay, now do the exact same thing in purple, but 4 blocks higher than the block u just placed
<Architect> place 1 block
<Architect> in the same column
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> 1 sec
<Builder> ok
<Architect> okay move the right 1 block
<Architect> move forward
<Architect> look so your facing the purple block
<Architect> this is reference for the rest of this build
<Builder> ok
<Architect> go 1 block back and place a yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> okay now pretend the yellow block is the center of a 3x3
<Builder> ok
<Builder> purple?
<Architect> place a red block on the top, left, right, and bottom of this yellow block
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> fill the gaps of the 3x3 with orange
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now place a yellow block in front of the first yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> now move infront of it
<Architect> this is new reference. pretend this is now the center of a 5x5
<Builder> ok
<Architect> on the corner of our 5x5 we have yellow blocks
<Architect> so if you went diagonal right down, you would see orange, then yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]

<Architect> the top 2 blocks need to be 1 higher
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:-2]

<Builder> good?
<Architect> okay now see how there's 3 spaces between the yellow
<Architect> place a red block in the center of each
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:0]
