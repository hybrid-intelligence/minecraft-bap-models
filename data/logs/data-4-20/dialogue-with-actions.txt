<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello! ready?
<Builder> yup!
<Architect> alright. we're gonna start with two green blocks next to each other in the center
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> actually, make that 4 in a 2x2 square
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah!
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> so two more on the ground
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> okay, now, continue that staircase with a 2x3 stack in the back

<Builder> oaky
<Architect> on top of the middle red block, put an orange block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
<Architect> on the top left corner red block, place an orange block to its left
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> this is the top right corner of the handle for the pot, which will be 2x3 in size
<Architect> so you can make a C shape starting with that block
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yup!
<Architect> finally, we have the spout
<Architect> on the second to topmost red block on the right side, put another red block to its right
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> that's the right location, but it should be red
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> finally, another red block diagonally up and right from that last block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> alright
<Architect> i think that's all
<Builder> sweet

B35-A39-C122-1524248727636
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this one looks like a little bird standing up, sort of
<Builder> okay
<Architect> let's start with the feet
<Architect> first, make an upside-down T shape in blue blocks
<Builder> how high?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> that's high enough
<Architect> oh wait
<Architect> remove the last one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> cool, now make the same shape parallel to it, one space away and aligned with it
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> done
<Architect> next, a 3x3 orange square sits on top of these and is centered
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> done
<Architect> now we'll make small wings
<Architect> on one side aligned with either foot, we need blocks coming out diagonally and up from that side
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> how many?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> it's just one for now
<Architect> it's a very small wing
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-4]
<Builder> gotcha
<Builder> is this good?
<Architect> yeah!
<Builder> cool
<Builder> same thing on other side?
<Architect> behind that one put an orange, and in front of it put a red
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Architect> then you can do the same thing on the other side
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> done
<Architect> cool
<Architect> last thing is a yellow head
<Architect> it will be coming off the square from the other side
<Architect> on top of the middle orange block on that side of the square, put a yellow block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> then one more hanging off the side
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> cool, i think that's it, let me check
<Builder> sounds good
<Architect> all good
<Architect> nice work
<Builder> thanks! you too

B35-A39-C130-1524249079307
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> i don't really know how to describe this one
<Builder> lol all good
<Architect> just looks like random stuff
<Architect> start by putting a hollow 3x3 square flat on the ground, using green
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> on the other side from where you're standing, make a step up like a staircase, also 3 wide
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yup!
<Builder> cool
<Architect> we'll step up twice more, but the second step in the staircase (the one you'll make first) is hollow in the middle
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:5]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:5]
<Builder> okay
<Architect> looks good
<Architect> so now we're going to make that last part of the structure with the three steps again, but they'll be lying on their side
<Architect> go back to the original viewpoint you had when you made that square
<Builder> okay
<Builder> am I building towards me?
<Architect> you'll place one on the ground then build upwards
<Architect> then away from you
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> so first put a blue block diagonally down and right from teh bottom right corner of the square
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> sorry haha this structure is kind of separate from the green one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> oh okay gotcha lol
<Architect> make that a pillar of 3
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> now diagonally up and right from there, you'll make the hollow stair
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> uhh
<Builder> I don't quite follow
<Architect> so if you take a directly top-down view, it will look like a staircase going up and right
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> oh okay
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> yup!
<Architect> then the last stair
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> nice, think that's it
<Builder> sweet!

B35-A39-C105-1524249475661
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hmm, another one i can't really describe
<Architect> but this one is all on same plane, standing up
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> also, it takes up the whole width of the board
<Architect> so let's start on the left
<Builder> sounds good
<Architect> make a 2x2 yellow square standing up
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> okay
<Architect> now, make a red 2x3 rectangle such that the top right block of the square is left of the bottom left block of the rectangle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> 2x3 longside on the ground?
<Architect> short side on the ground
<Builder> or shortside on the ground?

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Builder> ok
<Architect> nice
<Architect> on the other corner that's on the far edge of the table, place an orange block

<Builder> like that?
<Architect> haha sorry i am being confusing
<Architect> keep that one for now
<Builder> okay
<Architect> you're adding two blocks
<Architect> if you take a top view, the blocks you have right now are the corners of a 2x2 square

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> let me rephrase
<Builder> yeah I'm a little confused
<Architect> from the top most reds, place a block below each but leave a space
<Architect> so these new blocks will be two blocks below the original ones

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> Hello, this one is a little weird, it's a lot of triangles in weird places.
<Builder> let's do it
<Architect> Ok, somewhere in the middle and off to the left, make a line of orange blocks that is 5 long. It should be parrallel to the edge in front of you

<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Yup.
<Architect> let's getr started on the red triangle.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> If you look at the right side of the orange triangle, you should see the 2nd block from the ground, right?
<Builder> here?
<Architect> One up and to the right of that, we will put a red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Sorry, it should be as if you made a stair coming from the orange triangle

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> Perfecty
<Builder> ok
<Architect> The red triangle is upside down and is perpendicular to the orange triangle
<Builder> oooo
<Builder> ok

<Architect> Perfect, now we just need to do the green triangle
<Builder> ok
<Architect> If you float to the left side of the red triangle,
<Architect> We are going to put the green triangle's point on the side of the bottom of the two red blocks
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Sorry, I was vague, It shoudl be rright above your head

B25-A51-C154-1524263241350
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> and we're back
<Architect> this is gonna be a difficult one lol
<Builder> we got this
<Architect> okay so let's start on the edge closest to you
<Architect> make a 1x2 column of red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-3]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> okay so right behind that column, make a 1x3 column of blue
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Architect> so on the top blue block, make 3 additional blocks to the right of it (in blue)
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> so under the most right blue block (that you just made), put 2 additional blocks under it so it makes a column and touches the ground
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> perfect, so to the left of that newly made column, make a column of 2 reds
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-4]
<Architect> other side, so that it's under the little doorframe thing of blue
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> great, so move to the right so that the new blue colum is facing you
<Architect> okay so make a 1x3 colum of orange on the right side of the blue column
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> okay good, now to the right of that orange column, make a 1x2 orange column
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> okay good, so on top of the blue and 2 orange columns, place 1 purple column on top of each column respectively
<Builder> how tall
<Architect> just one purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> great, now can you put 1 layer of purple block sticking out towards you? so that they're branching off
<Architect> just one layer
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> great
<Architect> we'll do the same with the side to the left, with the red columns
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-5]
<Architect> so make an additional layer of purple on top of the blue
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> okay so go back to that view
<Architect> can you get rid of the purple on the 1x2 red column and the purple block to the left of it?
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-5]
<Architect> good, now fill the space between the 2 purples (on top of the blue) with purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Architect> okay so on that top layer of purple, stick 1 additional layer of purple so it's sticking out towards you
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-6]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-6]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Architect> great, now get rid of the left and right corner blocks
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-5]
<Architect> nice, now let's move to the left side
<Architect> so to the left of that blue column, make a 1x3 orange column
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> great, thanks
<Builder> yea no problem
<Architect> okay so in this view, we'll make a 2x1 layer of green that's connecting the 2 orange columns
<Builder> is it floating
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> nope
<Architect> great so then on the bottom of that green, make another 2x1
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> sorry, other isde
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> great, now do another one
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> one more
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> okay so then get rid of the the 2x1 layer that's directly toucing the orange columns
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> great so then on the 2nd row, put another layer of 2x1 green
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> okay so now get rid of the 2nd layer that's farthest away from you
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> and now on the row closest to you, put a 2x1 layer of yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> and that should be it!
<Builder> yay
