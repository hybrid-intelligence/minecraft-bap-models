<Architect> Howdy!
<Builder> hi!
<Architect> you'll need only green blocks. we are making a chair
<Builder> ok, sounds good
<Architect> okay, go ahead and place a green block down in teh cetner of the palte
<Architect> whoa sorry bad typing.
<Builder> ha no worries
<Architect> okay, now leaving a gap space, place another block in the row you are standing in.
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> so you are going to move two rows over
<Builder> ok
<Architect> and place a block on the same row as the gap. Kind of making a triangle
<Architect> place a stack of two in the middle
<Builder> the middle of all 3 blocks?
<Architect> yes.
<Architect> remove the bottom block of the stack
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> add another block to the top of the highest block
<Architect> then, add one block to every side of that block, not including the top side
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes!
<Architect> So finish off by making that cross a sqaure by filling in the corners. like the seat of a chair
<Builder> ok
<Architect> go to the side of the chair where the top iof the triangle base is.
<Architect> yes
<Architect> on that side, on top of the chair seat, build a chair back two blocks tall.
<Architect> Done!
<Builder> great!

<Architect> so this shape will be entirely floating one block off the plate.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> it will look like a little red-head green bodied dude riding a orange and yellow pitchfork like a surfboard. bear with me
<Builder> ha ok
<Architect> floating one block above the plate, make a row of five orange blocks, somewhere near the center of the board.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> perfect1
<Architect> on your right side, add two yellow blocks to the end
<Architect> on the yellow block touching the orange, add two blocks to either side of it. making a t.
<Builder> what color blocks?
<Architect> yellow
<Architect> great
<Architect> the next two blocks will be off the corners of each of those, in the direction of the last yellow block.
<Builder> like that, or somewhere else?
<Architect> add one more block to the end of that on your side
<Architect> and do the same on the other side
<Architect> so now remove the 2 and 4 block in the row of five you just made
<Builder> ah I see
<Architect> so now the green dude
<Architect> on the middle orange block, place a stack of three green blocks
<Architect> place a red block on top.
<Architect> place one green block on the top green block's side for an arm, and another opposite of it.
<Architect> done!
<Builder> nice

B37-A23-C105-1523630488223
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this is a fancy wall we are making.
<Architect> go to the middle of a side and place a yellow block
<Architect> perfect. place another yellow block in the same row, inward
<Architect> place one one top of each
<Architect> the row these two blocks are in is the only row we are working in.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> across these, on the other side of the row, build the same
<Builder> ok
<Architect> the middle part of the wall is floating one above plate
<Architect> it is a red row
<Architect> between the tops of the yellows.
<Builder> so it's 7 blocks long?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> remvoe the middle three and make them orange
<Architect> above the orange, stack two more oranges
<Architect> each orange should have two on top of it
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place reds in the same fashion on the red blocks
<Architect> remove the middle orange blocks.
<Builder> the middle row?
<Architect> yes. horizontal
<Architect> alright last bit here. on each of the top corners, we need two more yellow squares.
<Builder> on top of the red blocks?
<Architect> above the yellow blocks.
<Architect> place a stack of three yellow blocks above the most inward yellow block.
<Builder> when you say square, is that four blocks?
<Architect> yes.
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> remove the two red blocks on the bottom of that 3-stack. the ones ou just placed
<Architect> yellow*
<Architect> make that corner yellow block the bottom corner of a 2x2 yellow sqaure
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> just like that.
<Architect> done!
<Builder> yay

B37-A23-C95-1523631151562
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> i have no idea what this is.
<Builder> haha oh well
<Architect> place four red blocks in a sqaure on the plate
<Architect> orange
<Architect> make a table
<Builder> orange on top of red?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> add one more layer around the outside
<Builder> a layer of orange next to the existing orange?
<Architect> just on the top, like a table
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> remove the middle orange square of 4
<Architect> floating one above the red sqaure, make a purple sqaure 2x2
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> oops, place one on top of each of those, then remove the bottom purple layer.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> last part.
<Architect> go above the purple sqare and place a block on the corner
<Builder> purple blocks again?
<Architect> only purple from noe on.
<Architect> now
<Builder> not sure what you mean by corner
<Architect> thats exactly it.
<Builder> oh ok
<Architect> place one more on the top of that
<Architect> remove the middle piece
<Architect> on your right, place a block on the side of the floating one
<Architect> place another on the right of that
<Architect> place one on either side of the middle purple block on that one, and one on the top of it.
<Architect> we should be done!
<Builder> weird shape :)

B37-A23-C106-1523631763706
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> in the middle of the board, make a stack of three red blocks, with two on either side of the top block liek a 'T'
<Architect> on the right side, place two blocks on the top of the t
<Architect> a stack
<Builder> in a stack?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place one more, and then one going off it away from the t
<Builder> at the top?
<Architect> on top of the stack uy
<Architect> remove the top block support.
<Architect> on that same diagonal line upward, place a green block.
<Architect> below the hanging red, hang two green blocks.
<Architect> on the bottom of those two, place a green block on every side but the bottom.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> fill in the two green corners
<Architect> and on that side, in the middle of the green, place one more block on the side.
<Builder> there?
<Architect> eys
<Architect> yes
<Architect> on the other side of the t now
<Architect> place a block on the diagonal of the red.
<Architect> red block
<Builder> diagonal in which direction?
<Architect> upward
<Architect> place a green on that same diagona;
<Architect> I think we are done!
<Builder> cool

B37-A23-C100-1523632209802
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> are my commands working well for you? anything you would like to recommend?
<Builder> no, I think it's working well
<Architect> we are making four interlocking rings, all in one row.
<Architect> go to the middle of a side and place a green block
<Architect> place three more inward on that row
<Architect> on the far side block, stack three
<Architect> and then bring one across, attached to the top block.
<Architect> now a yellow block
<Architect> below that yelow, place two more yellows
<Architect> on the loner green, place a yellow
<Architect> on top of that, place to greens.
<Architect> going outward from the yellow block placed above the loner green, put two yellow blocks.
<Architect> on the last of those, place a yellow, orange, then yellow stack.
<Architect> on the yellow top block side facing green, place, an orange, a yellow, and a yellow
<Architect> make that last one yellow
<Builder> oops right
<Architect> in the orange corner, place an orange.
<Architect> on top of those oranges, place to more orange
<Architect> and off the top side of that, going left, place three more orange.
<Architect> go down one orange on the end
<Architect> now place a red.
<Architect> on either side of the red, place aonther red
<Architect> place one more red on that side.
<Architect> hang three red blocks from that one
<Architect> connect the bottom red to the yellow
<Architect> make that red a sqaure like the rest.
<Architect> add the missing orange
<Architect> done!
<Builder> nice! that went smoothly
<Architect> I agree!

B37-A23-C104-1523632889288
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> So this one is like a two legged spider. You'll see what I mean shortly.
<Architect> go to the middle of one side
<Architect> one row inward from the side, stack five red
<Builder> ok
<Architect> on the other side, one row in, stack another five red blocks.
<Architect> connect the tops with a red bridge.
<Architect> good
<Architect> the rest are orange/
<Architect> on the top of the middle three red, place a block. not a stack
<Architect> perfect. on either side of that, on the oranges, place a row of three blocks. should be a 3X3 square
<Architect> when looking down on it
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> on the hanging oranges, hang one block off of each block. on both sides.
<Builder> ok
<Architect> the side you are on is the front.
<Architect> and we will only be working on this side for the rest
<Architect> add one more hanging row
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> and then add a hanging row of five across
<Builder> are these still orange blocks? because I'm going to run out of orange
<Architect> okay. you will be removing the middle block of the last row you added. and the middle three blocks of the row youre about to add.
<Architect> does that make sense?
<Builder> I think so
<Architect> perfect!
<Builder> yay
<Architect> okie dokie we are done!
<Builder> sweet

B37-A23-C107-1523633626568
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> You ready?
<Builder> yes!
<Architect> we are about to make a really boxy Ventruvian man
<Builder> haha ok
<Architect> so on the middle ish, stack two red blocks. Not exactly in the middle. like two away from it
<Architect> that will work
<Architect> three spaces away, same row, place two orange stack
<Builder> towards the middle?
<Architect> sure
<Architect> place one more red and orange on top of each block, respectively
<Architect> then place a cooridnating color on each stack going inward.
<Architect> remove the tops of each stack.
<Architect> above the orange float, place a red, and vice versa
<Architect> off the upward diagonal of the red, place a red, and same with orange on otehr side.
<Architect> stack an orange on orange, and red on red
<Architect> make another square like the one below on those, except its flipped to match the stacks you just made.
<Builder> so that's above the existing columns at the top?
<Architect> yes.
<Architect> that is his head. attach yellow blocks outward from his shoulders.
<Builder> there?
<Architect> perfect.
<Architect> add one more to each side to make his arms longer
<Architect> done!
<Builder> awesome

B37-A23-C110-1523634174791
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one will be hard. yikes.
<Builder> whooo
<Builder> exciting
<Architect> its all flaoting one above the plate
<Builder> ok
<Architect> somewhere in the middle, place a green
<Architect> maybe not there. closer to a corner
<Architect> that will work
<Architect> stack one on top
<Architect> remove bottom
<Architect> on two sides of it, place another green.
<Architect> change the left most to purple
<Architect> on the opposite side, on the right green, stick another gree
<Architect> remove that. on the side opposite to you.
<Builder> there?
<Architect> one over
<Architect> there. stack a green on that
<Architect> add a purple to the side of the purple, on your side.
<Builder> there?
<Architect> yes. on the right side of that, purple.
<Architect> purple on that
<Architect> on your side, red on top purple.
<Architect> add one more red to that same side
<Architect> add red to top
<Architect> of that one
<Architect> add a red to the side you are facing
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> add blue same side
<Architect> add a blue to the side of the blue facing the purple.
<Architect> add one below that.
<Architect> add a blue to the corner of green and blue\
<Architect> i think we are done!
<Builder> yay, nice job!
<Architect> you too!

B34-A31-C3-1523649983538
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Hello
<Builder> hi
<Architect> We will build something very simple. It looks like a small 'L'
<Builder> alright
<Architect> It will be made entirely out of blue blocks
<Builder> do you want to do something like an x-y coordinate system?
<Architect> Place two blocks next to one another on the ground
<Architect> No, no x-y coordinate system
<Architect> Perfect, not on top of the left block, put another blue block
<Architect> Perfect! We're done with this warm up

B35-A44-C32-1523650068421
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello I'm ready
<Builder> same
<Architect> I mean are you ready? lol mb
<Architect> please don't move at the beginning of the missions
<Builder> sorry
<Architect> place 3 blue blocks horizontally anywhere you want
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> place 2 blue blocks on top of the left most blue block
<Builder> relative to my position correct?
<Architect> that's good

B34-A31-C108-1523650132924
<Builder> hello again
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> How was that warm up
<Builder> hi there again
<Builder> that was fine
<Architect> Good, we will be buildig the U of I Block "I"
<Builder> what colors are required?
<Architect> This first sequence will be made of blue blocks
<Architect> In the middle of the white blocks, build a line of five blue blocks
<Architect> Perfect! Now build six more blocks on top of one of the end blocks
<Builder> vertical or horizantal(flat)
<Builder> that good?
<Architect> That's right
<Builder> egg-cellent
<Architect> Now on the other end, build six more blocks on top so you have two towers on either side of the base
<Builder> like that
<Architect> Great! Now connect the two top blocks, you should only need three blue blocks to do this
<Builder> I'm guessing this is the frame?
<Architect> Correct
<Architect> We will build the "I" portion now with orange blocks
<Architect> Put three orange blocks within the base of the frame so they are on top of the first layer of blue
<Builder> same thing on top?
<Architect> Yes, now build upward from the middle orange block
<Architect> Same thing on top to finish the
<Architect> "I"
<Architect> Perfect!
<Builder> do we need to fill that in?
<Architect> Nope, it is correct
<Builder> great

B35-A44-C111-1523650278312
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> let me know when/where to begin
<Architect> hello ok we're building a 3x3 tower that is 3 blocks tall and has a hollow center column
<Architect> start by placing a 3x3 purple square flat on the ground
<Builder> all three levels are hallow in the center?
<Builder> IE I use 8 block per level
<Architect> these blocks are for scafolding. we will delete them later. yes all 3 levels are hollow I'll explain if you do anything wrong
<Builder> okay
<Architect> ok now step off it
<Architect> please don't move the camera
<Architect> 2 red blocks above the two left purple blocks in front of you
<Builder> oh sorry. are you getting my feed?
<Builder> so the back 2 blocks or the front 2?
<Architect> yes I see your camera so I need you to not move it so I can give accurate instructions
<Architect> left 2 purple blocks. 2 red blocks on top
<Builder> in the first row with 3 blocks, the 2nd row with 2 blocks or the third row?
<Builder> Could you rephrase it
<Architect> place 2 red blocks in front of the two purple blocks left most of the set of 3 purple blocks directly in front of you
<Builder> so was that a correct spot?
<Builder> or the 2 behind the placement I just made
<Architect> ok nevermind different strategy. what you have down isn't what I wanted but it is correct anyways
<Architect> ok the column to the right of the column you just built is red, then orange on top
<Builder> correct?
<Architect> red then orange on top
<Architect> flip them
<Builder> whoops
<Builder> okay whats next
<Architect> next is 2 orange to the right of that
<Builder> okay
<Architect> green orange Next: green green
<Builder> okay
<Architect> green yellow
<Architect> yellow yellow
<Architect> red yellow
<Architect> now remove all the puprple blocks
<Builder> okay
<Architect> ok we're done good job
<Builder> litttttttttt

B34-A31-C109-1523650510682
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello again
<Architect> Hello. This next one is abstract
<Builder> fun
<Architect> In the center, build a tower of five yellow blocks
<Architect> Good, now we will be using red blocks
<Architect> Place a red block on one side of the top yellow block
<Architect> Now look at the structure so the red block is on the right
<Architect> Place another red block on the back side of the current red block
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Sorry, the other side of the red block
<Architect> Yes, like that
<Builder> alright
<Architect> Now place another red block to the right of the red block you just placed
<Builder> there
<Builder> do you want me to stand at a different perspective or is this the easiest position?
<Architect> Good, now fill in red blocks on the underside of the existing red blocks, so they are two layers high
<Builder> like a flag
<Builder> ish
<Architect> It does look like a flag. We are done with this building phase

B35-A44-C114-1523650699269
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> im ready
<Architect> build a orange column that is 5 orange blocks tall
<Architect> anywhere
<Builder> okay
<Architect> place 2 blocks to the right of the highest block and lowest block of the pillar
<Builder> any color or still orange?
<Architect> unless I specify, keep same color
<Builder> okay
<Architect> now placce 1 block next to the middle block of the column (to the right)
<Architect> should look like letter E
<Builder> okay
<Architect> now you will create the exact shape, but mirrored horizontally, (1 sppace forward) and in blue
<Builder> okay
<Architect> make the back of the blue lettere E line up with the tips of the orange letter E.
<Architect> shift the whole blue thing 2 blocks to the right
<Builder> oh so they look superimposed
<Architect> yes mb
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> oh wait sorry i wasnt looking 100% correctly. make the blue things that stick out only 1 block. so just remove 2 blocks
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> ok. we're done sorry. gj
<Builder> no worries

B34-A31-C91-1523650839792
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> This one is a very colorful castle
<Architect> Ready for it?
<Builder> of course
<Architect> About four blocks from an edge, put down an orange block
<Builder> ??
<Architect> That is good
<Architect> To the left of the orange block, place two more orange blocks
<Architect> Great
<Architect> Put another layer of orange blocks on top of that
<Builder> lmk if you want me to move
<Architect> Perfect! Now we will use blue. Next to one end of that orange wall, building a blue pillar three blocks high
<Architect> Okay, I will let you know if I need you to move, thanks
<Builder> is this 2D or 3D?
<Architect> It will be 3D
<Architect> On top of the blue pillar, place one yellow block
<Architect> Great, do that same blue pillar and yellow block, but on the other edge of the orange wall
<Builder> is this one face?
<Architect> Yes, we will begin to make it 3D
<Architect> We will use purple blocks now
<Architect> If you could, move to the other side of the wall
<Architect> Right there
<Builder> left or right side?
<Architect> Coming off the blue pillar on the right, place three purple blocks moving away from the structure
<Architect> Just like that
<Builder> one more layer?
<Architect> Building one more layer
<Architect> Perfect, you can make another one of those coming off the other blue pillar
<Builder> blue pillar with yellow block?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> Nice
<Builder> what color?
<Builder> for the last wall?
<Architect> Now we will build the gate; it will be red
<Builder> oh a gate
<Builder> fancy
<Architect> Build a tower of red blocks three high next to one of the blue pillars
<Architect> Do the same on the other side
<Architect> Perfect, now one red block connecting the two top red blocks
<Architect> Awesome, let me just double check to make sure it's complete
<Builder> alright
<Architect> Looks good to me

B35-A44-C94-1523650963951
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> im ready
<Architect> how many have we done so far again?
<Builder> 3
<Architect> ok near the bottom of the building platform, build a 5x5 hollow red square that is vertical
<Builder> 1 level tall?
<Builder> bottom left or right?
<Architect> no it is vertical so it is 5 blocks tall and 5 blocks wide. 1 block depth
<Architect> center bottom
<Architect> and it is hollow
<Builder> is this looking like what you want it to?
<Architect> you're done fine keep going
<Builder> i dont have enought blocks
<Architect> the center is hollow. there is a 3x3 space in the imddle that is hollow
<Builder> gotcha
<Builder> oaky
<Builder> okay*
<Architect> ok now place an orange block anywhere in the red ring
<Architect> and keep this point of view that you have
<Builder> okay
<Architect> ok now place an orange block in front of that one
<Architect> remove the first orange block and turn the second orange block into a 3x3 square with a hollow center. the second orange block is the bottom left of the hollow 3x3 orange square
<Builder> okay
<Architect> create the orange shape except its yellow. right in front of the orange
<Builder> okay
<Architect> next place 1 green block 1 space forward of the empty space that the yellow hollow square has
<Architect> then blue in front
<Architect> then an empty space, then a purple
<Architect> ok good job
<Builder> that it?
<Architect> yes

B35-A44-C95-1523651338167
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> sorry for cutting you off near the end.
<Builder> no worries
<Architect> place a 2x2 red square on the ground near center
<Builder> okay
<Architect> place an orange block anywhere on that red thing
<Architect> place 1 orange block in front of that one
<Architect> and remove the initial orange block. turn the second orange block into a rim around the red thing.
<Builder> okay
<Architect> ok now place a 2x2 purple block flat setup 3 spaces above the red 2x2
<Architect> it should be floating
<Architect> 3 spaces means 2 empty spaces between the purple and red.
<Architect> sorry
<Builder> okay
<Architect> pick any corner of the purple shape and place 1 purple block 2 spaces above it. (1 empty space between)
<Architect> turn that purple block into a tetris t shape. the singlular purple floating block is the center of the t. The t is upside down
<Architect> oh wait nevermind sorry
<Architect> undo all those steps. just keep the single purple block
<Builder> okay
<Architect> lemme think a bit
<Builder> if its easier we can build relative to my direction around this block
<Architect> ok place 2 blocks in front of the floating singular purple block
<Builder> okay
<Architect> of the three floating blocks. focus on the center block. place 3 blocks around the center. 1 to the left, 1 to the right, 1 above
<Builder> okay
<Architect> the left and right block need to be to the eleft and right of the center block
<Architect> so move them down 1
<Architect> ok we're done good job
<Builder> gotcha
<Builder> littttttt

B34-A31-C113-1523651402802
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> :)
<Architect> This one is a little difficult, we will be building some large numbers
<Builder> like the block I but it's a number
<Builder> how many digits?
<Architect> Right
<Architect> First we will make a 2
<Builder> and what color(s)
<Architect> The 2 will be green
<Architect> In the middle, make a row of three green blocks
<Builder> should I move that?
<Architect> The placement is fine, but switch to the other side
<Builder> shift it?
<Architect> Good
<Architect> Now on the left block, build two more green blocks upward
<Architect> Two green blocks to the right, off the top green block
<Builder> this is going to be like a HEX 2?
<Architect> Yeah, the top part of the 2 now.
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Perfect!
<Architect> Now go to the lower righthand corner of the two
<Architect> Behind the right-most green block, place a purple block
<Builder> there?
<Builder> that's behind
<Architect> Yes, that's good
<Builder> gr8
<Architect> Now moving right, place two more purple blocks
<Architect> This one will be an 8
<Builder> same height?
<Architect> Correct, same height
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> That's good
<Architect> Now come to the side of the 8 so the 2 is behind the 8
<Architect> Go to the bottom righthand corner of the 8
<Architect> Place a yellow block diagonal to the corner of the 8
<Builder> there?
<Architect> Yes
<Architect> Now two more yellow blocks to the right of that
<Builder> alright. What number is this?
<Architect> 6
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Nice, that's perfect
<Architect> Now go to the bottom right corner of the 6
<Architect> I'm sorry, bottom left corner. My mistake
<Builder> you good
<Architect> Place an orange block right infront of that yellow block
<Architect> Good, now make it a tower the same heigh as the other numbers
<Architect> Nice, it will be a 7. So we just need two more orange blocks off the left side of the tower
<Architect> Fantastic. Let me just double check this
<Builder> just a bunch of colorful numbers
<Architect> Looks fine to me, good job

B35-A44-C99-1523651769587
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> I think I'm ready to go pro at this
<Architect> haha
<Architect> ok we're building a 2d vertical drawing. start at the left column and build 3 yellow blocks. begin the drawing all the way to the left of the platform, and near the center
<Architect> instructions are kinda confusing I'll keep walking you through it
<Builder> this perspective?
<Architect> build a column of 3 yellow blocks. begin all the weay to left, center
<Architect> no stand still and look forward on the ground. it is a 2d veritcal drawing
<Builder> this?
<Architect> ok that's the first column. good. next column is to the right of it. its yellow, empty, yellow
<Architect> so yellow on the ground, empty above, yellow above the emtpy
<Architect> next column is 3 empty
<Architect> sorry 3 yellow
<Builder> okay
<Architect> next: empty, yellow,
<Architect> empty, yellow
<Builder> like this
<Architect> sorry remove that last one.
<Architect> every time I type. I'm giving you instructions for the next column unless specified otherwise
<Builder> okay
<Architect> empty yellow
<Architect> empty 3 yellow
<Architect> empty 2 yellow
<Architect> empty 3 yellow
<Architect> completely empty
<Architect> empty blue
<Architect> ok now we're making a blue key so rotate your view 90 degrees
<Architect> to the right
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> you rotated 90 to the left
<Builder> same design? just blue?
<Architect> not the same design
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> next column: empty 2 blue
<Architect> empty 3 blue
<Architect> empty 2 blue
<Architect> now go back to the first blue block you placed. we're building left of it now
<Architect> empty blue
<Builder> okay
<Architect> 3 blue
<Architect> blue empty, blue
<Architect> 3 blue
<Architect> ok we're done good job
<Builder> go team
<Architect> I will use this format for communication on other 2d veritcal or horizontal drawings

<Architect> Hmm, not sure what these are. We will figure it out along the way
<Builder> alright sure
<Architect> This first object will be made of red blocks
<Architect> About one block in from a corner, place a red block
<Builder> one block in is towards me?
<Builder> so like there?
<Architect> Sorry, one block away from a corner. That needs to be a little closer to an edge
<Architect> That's perfect
<Builder> oh from a corner. I read center
<Architect> Lol, no worries
<Architect> Now look at it so the red block is in the bottom left corner of the large white base
<Architect> Stack three more red blocks on top of the existing red block.
<Builder> just like that
<Architect> Great, now off of the top red block, build four more blocks going toward the right edge of the white base
<Builder> in red?
<Architect> Yes, red
<Architect> Just like that
<Architect> Connect the top right block to the ground. It should be just like the other end of the red structure
<Builder> perfect
<Architect> Cool, now build two red blocks downward from the middle red block
<Architect> It should look like an 'm'
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> Awesome. Like that
<Architect> Now we will be working in yellow for the rest of the object
<Architect> Go to the bottom right corner of the 'm'
<Architect> Behind the 'm' place a yellow block so there is one block space between it and the bottom right red block
<Architect> Great
<Builder> ;)
<Architect> Place another yellow block on top of that. We will delete this block later
<Builder> I'm going to make it purple so I remember to delete it
<Architect> Place a yellow block of the left side of that block you just put down
<Architect> Good idea
<Architect> You can delete the purple block now
<Architect> Build another yellow block on top of the one you just put down
<Architect> And put one purple block on top of that (to delete later)
<Architect> On the right side of that purple block, place a yellow block
<Builder> I'ts hard to find a good perspective for you
<Builder> *It's
<Architect> It's okay, we're doing good
<Architect> You can delete the purple block
<Architect> Build two more yellow blocks going to the right off that top yellow block
<Architect> Awesome, now place one yellow block on the underside of the middle block
<Architect> Great. Now place a purple block on the right side of the top yellow row
<Builder> is this symmetrical?
<Architect> Two yellow blocks coming down from that purple one
<Architect> Yep, it's symmetrical
<Builder> ??
<Architect> Not sure what they are, but that's complete
<Builder> yeah idk
<Architect> nice work

<Builder> okay
<Architect> empty 2 red, 2 empty, 1 green
<Architect> 2 empty on the not 1 empty. before the green
<Architect> 2 spaces between the red and green on the second column
<Architect> wait stop I'm making a correction
<Builder> yeah I don't follow
<Builder> can u rephrase?
<Architect> on the second column. I said empty, 2 red, 2 empty, green
<Builder> okay
<Architect> 3rd column: 3 empty, 3 green

<Architect> ok roate 180 degrees
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> place 2 red blocks in front of the two red blocks you see.
<Architect> then blocks to the left of the two oyu placed
<Architect> ok we're done gj
<Builder> def the hardest 1

B35-A44-C113-1523652699693
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one is hard
<Architect> in a 3x5 space, build a blocky looking number 2. vertical. green
<Architect> preferably near the top of building plane
<Architect> top center sorry
<Architect> you need space to the left and right of it but not behind it
<Architect> ok wait my bad
<Architect> stop. I gave some bad instructions
<Builder> okay
<Architect> its oriented differently
<Builder> okay.
<Architect> near the bottom of the plane do what you just did. not the top
<Builder> bottom center?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> okay
<Architect> fill in those 2 center corners
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> no to make it look like a 2. sorry the other corners
<Builder> that?
<Architect> no it looks like a number 2.
<Architect> um the blocks left and right of the very center block
<Builder> that?
<Architect> no, you just placed 2 blocks above and below the very center block
<Architect> 2 blocks to the left and right of the very center block
<Builder> LOL my bad
<Architect> ok nice. now we're building a purple number 8. it is behind the 2 but not superimposed. the 8 is also 3x5
<Architect> start by building a column of 5 purple blocks behind the right column of the 2
<Builder> directly behind?
<Architect> yes directly behind
<Builder> okay
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> um. ok you need to shift it left by 1. I said the colun of 5 purples was directly behind the right column for the green 2
<Builder> gotcha
<Builder> okay
<Architect> now we're doing a 6. build a column of 5 yellow 1 space behind AND one space to the left of the left-most purple column
<Builder> so here?
<Builder> or 1 back
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now
<Architect> rotate 180
<Architect> build a seven with the leg of the seven in front of the left yellow column
<Builder> in yellow?
<Architect> orange
<Architect> sorry
<Architect> ok lemme check everything
<Builder> is it a slanted leg or straight
<Architect> we did it. nice
<Builder> littttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

<Architect> This is abstract and very colorful
<Architect> We will start with blue
<Builder> great
<Architect> Go to one of the edges of the white base
<Architect> One block from the edge, place a blue block near the middle
<Architect> Nice, now one more blue block on the backside of that
<Architect> And then two more blue blocks on top of the back-most blue block
<Architect> Yes, now we will use green
<Architect> On the left side of the top-most blue block, place two green blockws
<Builder> in a row like that?
<Architect> Yep, like that
<Architect> Now use green blocks to connect it to the ground. You should only need 2 green blocks to do that
<Builder> this is funky
<Architect> Lol, now move so the green portion is in front of the blue
<Architect> On the ground, place two green blocks moving to the left of the bottom green block
<Builder> um
<Architect> yeah, that's right
<Architect> Now two green blocks moving backwards from the left-most green block
<Builder> snek
<Architect> Great, now we will use yellow blocks
<Architect> On top of the green block farthest away from you, stack two yellow blocks
<Architect> Now two yellow blocks coming toward you from the top yellow blocks
<Builder> is this like a spiral of sorts?
<Architect> yes, exactly like a spiral
<Architect> Two yellow blocks to the left of the last one you placed
<Architect> And one yellow block moving down from that
<Architect> Nice, we will use orange now
<Builder> alright
<Builder> do I put one under the yellow?
<Architect> Yes
<Architect> Then two behind it
<Architect> And two up
<Architect> One to the left
<Architect> Awesome, now we will use red
<Architect> Two red blocks coming forward from that red one
<Builder> two in front now
<Builder> down?
<Architect> Down
<Architect> And back
<Architect> Nicee
<Architect> Let me just double check it
<Builder> abstract art
<Architect> good thing I double-checked, we need one more red block going left off the last one
<Builder> I think we are good
<Builder> though I dont really know
<Architect> Looks good to me

<Builder> okay. But starting from this red block?
<Architect> yes starting at the red block
<Architect> all empty
<Architect> red, empty, red
<Architect> no the first column is all empty
<Architect> oh
<Architect> I said rotate 180 degrees
<Builder> so still going left to Right

<Builder> do u want a specific angle?
<Architect> no I can fly around in this word and the world with the blueprint
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> its' good. looks like a spiral huh? tough one but good job
<Builder> I see it now
<Architect> wait
<Builder> yeah?
<Architect> nvm its correct. I thought I missed 1 block

<Architect> Back to basics, this one looks easy
<Builder> nice
<Architect> In the middle, build a tower of red blocks three high
<Architect> To the right of the bottom block, place another red block so it makes an 'L' shape
<Architect> Nice. Behind that red block, build a tower of yellow blocks three high
<Builder> I think we are getting the hang of this
<Architect> Most definitely, this is running very smoothly
<Architect> Now look so the yellow is in front of the red
<Architect> Make an upside-down 'L' out of yellow
<Builder> so do I put one on the left or the right?
<Architect> Sorry, on the right. It will connect to the red block
<Architect> Great, let me just double check
<Architect> Cool, looks all good to me
<Builder> neat

<Architect> Ahh, another harder one
<Builder> fun
<Builder> does it look like anything in particular?
<Architect> These will be 4x4 rings that interlock
<Builder> oh my
<Architect> One block away from the edge, place a green block
<Architect> Nice, now look at it so the green block is on the right side of the white base
<Architect> I'm sorry, I meant the left side
<Builder> here?
<Builder> there we go
<Architect> Lol
<Architect> Now build three more green blocks on top of that
<Architect> On the ground, three more green blocks going to the right of the bottom block, so it looks like an 'L'
<Builder> will this form a square?
<Architect> yes, but there will be some yellow in the middle
<Builder> ok
<Architect> On top of the right-most green block, put a yellow one
<Architect> And to the left of that, put another yellow one
<Architect> Three more yellow on top of the left one
<Architect> Oops, on top of the other yellow block
<Builder> sorry
<Architect> Perfect, now connect the green and yellow towers with a green blcok
<Builder> my b
<Architect> no worries
<Builder> left of the highest green block?
<Architect> To the right of the highest green
<Builder> kk
<Architect> On the right-most yellow block, stack two green blocks
<Architect> Cool
<Architect> Now a yellow one on top of those green
<Architect> from the bottom row of yellow, place two more yellow blocks going to the right
<Architect> And place a yellow on top of the right-most
<Architect> On top of that, an orange
<Architect> to the left of that, another orange
<Architect> Three more oranges on top of that left-most orange block
<Architect> Three more to the right
<Architect> And one down
<Architect> Place a red block on the bottom of the orange block
<Architect> And an orange below the red
<Architect> to the left of the red, place another red
<Builder> yes? no?
<Architect> now make the 4x4 square of red blocks, it will be hollow
<Architect> Nice, now we need one more yellow
<Architect> It will go where the yellow corner fits
<Architect> Yep, right there
<Architect> Let me double check this
<Builder> perfect
<Architect> Looks great to me, nice job
<Builder> :)

<Architect> sorry
<Builder> how many spaces
<Architect> actually
<Architect> you dont need to. we barely have enough space
<Architect> 3 red
<Architect> 3 blue 1 yellow
<Architect> rotate 90 degrees to the right
<Architect> the first column is the blue thing.
<Architect> next 3 columns are 2 purple each
<Builder> okay
<Architect> so
<Architect> build 3 (2 purple) columns
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yeah. the purple thing is a wall for a castle.
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> next is another watch tower which is 3 blue 1 yellow
<Architect> the back wall is orange
<Architect> this wall is purple
<Builder> okay
<Architect> ok done. good job

<Architect> 3 empty 1 red
<Architect> 4 red
<Architect> ok now 2 spaces behind the right most red column, place a yellow block on the ground
<Builder> here or 1 back
<Architect> you have placed a yellow block 3 spaces in front. it's 2 spaces behind
<Builder> okay
<Architect> it needs to be on the other side. behind
<Builder> sorry I've been thinking about it as 2 empty spaces. my B
<Architect> yes, you need to move the yellow block behind the red. not in front
<Architect> ok rotate 90 degrees to the right
<Architect> place a yellow block 3 spaces above that yellow
<Architect> (2 empty between)
<Architect> ok so this is another 2d drawing. you currentl have the 4th column done
<Architect> the 5th column (to the right) is emepty 2 yellow
<Architect> 1st column: empty 2 yellow
<Architect> the 5th column is also empty 2 yellow
<Architect> 3rd is yellow, 2 empty, yellow
<Architect> my bad I meant second

<Builder> how complex?
<Architect> Some of these objects will be floating
<Builder> is there any oclor we are not using>
<Architect> This first one we make will not be. This one will be built on the ground
<Architect> No, we will be using all six colors. We will use yellow first. After we finish this first one, we can use yellow as the 'delete' blockss
<Builder> ok
<Architect> So we will need yellow first. One block away from an edge, put a yellow block near the center
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> There ya go, that's good
<Architect> Moving toward the center, place three more yellow blocks
<Architect> On either side of the third yellow block, place another yellow so it looks like a cross
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> no more yellow will be needed
<Builder> ok
<Builder> very religious
<Architect> Using green, place two blocks diagonal from the top yellow block
<Builder> ??
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> There will be two other shapes like this, but they will be floating
<Builder> exactly the same?
<Architect> yes, just oriented differently and using different colors
<Builder> ok
<Architect> Place a yellow block diagonal to the left green block
<Builder> on which side?
<Architect> top left diagonal of the left green block
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> Place a red block on top
<Architect> You can delete the yellow
<Architect> Now two reds to the right of the current red
<Architect> I apologize, to the left of the curent red
<Architect> Perfect, now make a cross in the same direction of the yellow one
<Architect> The green blocks will be orange for this one
<Builder> what color are the ear things?
<Architect> They will also be floating
<Architect> Perfect, now move to the top right corner of the white base
<Architect> Right on the edge, in line with the orange ears, place a yellow block
<Builder> like that
<Architect> Perfect
<Architect> On top, place a purple block
<Architect> Purple will be thecross
<Architect> And blue ears
<Architect> I made a mistake, the whole purple and blue figure should be one block to the left, toward the red one
<Architect> yep, you got it
<Builder> great
<Architect> And let me just double check these
<Architect> Nice

<Builder> hi
<Architect> this is super easy
<Builder> rad! seems fun, easy way to earn some Amazon bucks
<Architect> youre gonna build a L with blue blocks so put down two blue blocks in a row and put one more on top of the left one
<Builder> like so?
<Architect> perfect

<Builder> want me to set something down for reference?
<Architect> yeah move that red block one spot toward the center
<Architect> stack 4 more red on top of it
<Architect> put a red block one spot from the edge on the opposite side
<Architect> and four on top of that
<Builder> easy enough
<Architect> and connect the two towers
<Builder> nice arch
<Builder> any more?
<Architect> place 3 orange on the three middle red
<Architect> on the top
<Architect> one orange tall on the three middle red
<Architect> so dont stack them
<Builder> oh, got you
<Builder> horizontal?
<Architect> then put three orange on the side of the red
<Architect> so just below those orange you placed
<Builder> i'm not sure i follow
<Builder> on the side of what red?
<Architect> on the middle of the arch
<Architect> but one space up
<Architect> so not below
<Builder> OH i got you
<Builder> sorry i am thinking in two dimensions
<Architect> place three orange on top of the ones you just placed
<Architect> and one below the far left orange and far right orange
<Builder> yeah?
<Architect> place another one below those as well
<Architect> and place another on the outer sides of those blocks
<Architect> and break the bottom middle orange
<Architect> on both sides
<Builder> is this your first time?
<Architect> on the other side of the structure youre going to place orange to cover the middle of the red arch
<Architect> and three on top of those
<Builder> three high? or like that?
<Architect> just like that we're done with this one

<Architect> hello
<Builder> hi again!
<Architect> so we are building a symetric structure
<Architect> lets start with a red block at some corner
<Architect> any corner is fine
<Architect> place three more blocks each touching a face of the block you just placed
<Architect> yeah that good
<Builder> cool
<Architect> no on the opposite side place the same thing with green blocks
<Architect> now*
<Architect> diagonally opposite sorry
<Architect> hmm.. can you place those blocks on the diagonally opposite corner of the red blocks?
<Builder> oh, wwo, sorry!
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yeah in that corner
<Architect> okay now where you had the green blocks before build the same thing but with yellow blocks
<Architect> and finally the opposite side with purple
<Architect> yes thats it :-)
<Builder> great! is it that the end? if you, you can quit if you'd like

<Architect> we're gonna need to make a 3x3 green square in the middle
<Architect> break the bottom middle top left and top right middle left and middle right
<Builder> crude
<Architect> ha
<Architect> place one on top of the middle then break the bottom one
<Architect> on top of that top black make a 3x3 matt
<Builder> 3x3 like what we started with?
<Architect> but on top of that block
<Builder> think i got it
<Architect> so don't include that block in the 3 x3 it should be resting on it
<Builder> i think it is
<Architect> go to the other side of the structure
<Builder> okay
<Architect> on that right row stack two on top
<Builder> hot or cold?
<Architect> remove the two left ones
<Architect> then put two on the other side of that green
<Architect> perfect
<Builder> is this what you mean?
<Builder> yay!

<Architect> looks like a witch riding a broom
<Architect> lets start with the broom
<Builder> okay, cool
<Architect> place five orange blocks in the center one block floating
<Architect> yeah like that do that for the rest.
<Architect> sorry
<Architect> all five blocks should be floating one above
<Builder> oh, okay!
<Architect> okay thats the stick of the broom time to add the tail
<Architect> place one yellow block at an end
<Architect> place one block on the front and back of this yellow block
<Builder> also yellow?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> okay the rest of the broom kinda looks like a trident or fork
<Architect> place one more yellow block at the end of the stick kinda like the first one
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now leaving one block empty add the trident fork
<Architect> maybe it would be easy if you put two more in front and back
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes do that again to make it wider
<Architect> sorry i meant make it a 3-5 instead of 3-3-3
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now for the witch
<Architect> she is in the middle of the orange.
<Architect> start with three green all in a form of a tower
<Architect> okay we need the arms perpendicular to the broom add two more green at the top most green block
<Architect> finally the head is red
<Architect> great

<Builder> where should we start?
<Architect> in the middle build a 3x3 wall of red
<Architect> and remove the middle block
<Architect> leaving one space inbetween make another 3x3 wall parallel to the red of blue
<Builder> also with a hole?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> connect them at the bottom with an orange block on both sides
<Builder> cozy
<Architect> sorry one side should be purple
<Builder> no biggie
<Architect> then connect at the top with the same colors
<Architect> done
<Builder> :)

B52-A27-C49-1523660730846

<Architect> build a 4x4 blue wall 4 spaces from an edge parallel to that edge
<Builder> got it
<Architect> but make the farthest right column purple
<Builder> like, resting on the 4th space?
<Builder> from the edge?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> okay
<Builder> right from which angle
<Builder> my current right?
<Architect> build from the other side then your right
<Builder> i think
<Architect> knock out the middle 2x2 of that wall and break the top purple
<Architect> go to the edge on your right and face the structure
<Architect> now build a 3x3 wall off of that
<Architect> include that column in the 3x3
<Builder> all purple?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> perpendicular to the current thing?
<Architect> yes but where forming a cube so shift over a column
<Builder> thanks
<Architect> and make the column on the right have 4 and also knock out the middle of the purple
<Builder> did i guess it?
<Builder> i can undo
<Architect> not quite take that down and put a 4 tall red column next to the purple
<Builder> lol
<Architect> the other side so extend the purple wall
<Architect> so now its gonna be a 4x3 wall of red
<Builder> parallel to the blue wall?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> and knock out the middle bottom and second from the top middle
<Builder> like an A
<Builder> ?
<Architect> last side is gonna be yellow so do a column of 4 yellow on that red
<Builder> is it the same shape as the purple?
<Architect> build over to the blue like you did with the purple
<Architect> yeah same as purple
<Builder> yeah?
<Builder> cute, A, b, C, d
<Architect> that looks good

<Architect> the long part of the L is 5 long
<Architect> green
<Builder> what color?
<Architect> for the bottom is three long
<Architect> sorry thats four long
<Architect> nice.
<Architect> now leaving one block for space add the "=" which is two blocks width
<Architect> purple
<Builder> where do i place it with respect to the length of L?
<Architect> one block down
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now leaving one more space place the 5 all blue
<Architect> its two for the width
<Architect> and same length as the L
<Architect> great :-)

<Architect> the cube is 2x2
<Architect> sorry my mistake its actually a square, just cut it in half
<Architect> its should be standing up
<Architect> rotate it by 90
<Architect> nice
<Architect> now put a yellow square same shape floating above this one
<Architect> two spaces appart
<Architect> on top
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes same thing on the other side the building area
<Builder> yellow?
<Architect> one the opposite edge
<Architect> yes
<Architect> okay now connect the two yellow cubes with a bridge of two red, followed by three oranges and two more red
<Architect> only the bottom
<Architect> the top of the squares
<Architect> yes like that
<Architect> okay now add a square of red on top of the two reds you just added
<Architect> similar to the yellow blocks
<Builder> both?
<Architect> one more row
<Architect> yes
<Architect> connect the top of the two red with three more oranges
<Architect> thats it

<Builder> like, one hanging over?
<Builder> no, like this
<Builder> two out
<Architect> the same as you did with the green
<Architect> on the same side as the green
<Builder> got it
<Architect> so instead of that higher yellow coming off of that side of the other one it should come off of the side closest to the green
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah and break the one to right and below it
<Architect> youre gonna add another yellow in the same fashion to the corner of the highest yellow
<Builder> toward the green?
<Architect> perfect
