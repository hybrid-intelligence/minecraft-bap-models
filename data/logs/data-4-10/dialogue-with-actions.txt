<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> We'll start with a diagonal on the ground of 4 yellow bricks
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> Now add 3 red bricks on the diagonal adjacent to the yellow bricks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Then add one more layer of red bricks
<Builder> above?
<Architect> On top of the red ones
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> Great! Proceed to do the same thing with green bricks on the other side of the diagonal
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]

[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> please put a purple brick on top of the middle red brick
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> Add a purple bricks adjacent to the purple bricks, away from the center of the object
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> on a diagonal or line?
<Architect> the last brick wil be in a diagonal
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> So from the side of the object, you should see two yellow-red-purple diagonals
<Architect> The most recently placed brick is out of place
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> it should be shifted one to its left
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> Perfect!
<Architect> There are now two yellow-red-purple diagonals. Add an orange brick to make them meet
<Architect> So there will be a yellow-red-purple-orange diagonal
<Architect> You'll have to add and remove a brick to get the orange brick to float
<Architect> the orange brick will be one level above the purple layer, and lie in the empty space between the three purple bricks
<Builder> please tell me where the orange brick should be floating
<Builder> where I'm standing
<Architect> Yes
<Builder> or floating
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> Awesome! now remove the purple brick that is in the middle of the little L of purple bricks
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> We'll cap off the object by adding two bricks on the ground, touching the green bricks diagonally
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> blue bricks
<Builder> like that?

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4]
<Builder> no prob
<Architect> ok nice
<Architect> now place 1 blue block on either side of the middle blue block to make a cross like a plus sign
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Builder> amen brother
<Architect> great you can remove that purple block now
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> ok the next cross is orange and flat. place 4 orange blocks extending to the right of the rightmost blue block
<Builder> like flat on the ground?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> nah it should be in the air

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Architect> yeah like that
<Builder> kk
<Architect> then place 1 orange block on the middle right orange block, on your side so that it comes toward you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Builder> we good?
<Architect> nice just like that. 2 more crosses
<Architect> oh put that orange one back, this one is supposed to be longer
<Architect> the whole figure is connected
<Builder> im getting positive vibes from this build
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:-4]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> ok next is yellow and it looks like the blue cross only with 1 more piece on each side and its flat. put the first block on the rightmost orange block from your view right now
<Architect> yup all good so far
<Builder> which face on the rightmost orange block does it go on?
<Builder> facing up, facing me, facing down
<Architect> facing you, it should be flat like the orange
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Architect> yup there
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> should be 2 more in that line and we can make the cross section
<Builder> can you explain what you meant by one more piece on each side?
<Builder> did you mean the middle piece?
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> right like that. then put 2 more on either side of the middle piece
<Builder> kk
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> there thats good. now we have 1 more and its green
<Architect> its upright like the blue and the middle piece is attached to the leftmost yellowpiece
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> not there, like 1 rotations to the right
<Architect> my bad, i try to describe it from where you were standing earlier
<Builder> oh ok lemme go back
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> how would you describe it from here?
<Architect> its should be directly across from the orange piece, that side. you had the shape and orientation right though. so on the right side from where you are
<Builder> on this block?
<Architect> yeah looks like it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> should be upright like the blue cross and attached at the middle of the new cross
<Builder> middle of the yellow cross?
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3]

<Architect> yeah like that
<Builder> or like that
<Builder> kk
<Architect> nice all done

B25-A3-C73-1523384830418
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this looks like someone tried to spell with blocks and failed
<Builder> LOL
<Builder> aight
<Builder> dimensions?
<Builder> WxLxH
<Builder> just so we develop a convention
<Architect> anyway all the letters go straight up so we just need to start at one side and go across. i'd say like 11x1x4
<Builder> kk
<Architect> lets start at the left. we need placeholder blocks to get it off the ground so use red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> ok put 1 purple block on top of that
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> then a red to the right of it
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> that works too. put 1 purple block to the right of the top red block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> my bad i misread that, but that still works?
<Architect> yeah. and 1 purple block on top of the top red block too
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> yeah that works. we will remove red later
<Builder> oh ok
<Architect> so this purple is kind of like an x if that helps. we need to put purple blocks in the top right and lower right of that center purple block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> yeah buddy
<Architect> now you can remove placeholders. the letters aren't connected
<Builder> k
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> ok next is yellow. it is also off the ground. place 2 reds on the ground 1 space awaay from the purple
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> i mean two reds side by side, then you can place 2 yellows on top of each
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> gotchu
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> nice. then put 2 more reds on top of the yellow and 2 yellows on top of the new reds
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> yup like that
<Architect> last is a green y shape. this one starts on the ground
<Architect> place 3 green blocks 1 space away from the yellows flat on the ground
[Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> then 3 on top of the rightmost green block so its upright
[Builder puts down a green block at X:4 Y:1 Z:2]

<Builder> yex
<Builder> or gex
<Architect> more like yikes
<Builder> with the g cut off
<Architect> alright on to the next one

B25-A3-C72-1523385295902
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> x = y more like x = bye
<Architect> right
<Architect> ok this one is weird
<Builder> kk pitch it to me
<Builder> we got this
<Architect> hmm i'd say 9x3x4 hard to tell. anyway we'll start with purple. these make the legs of the base figure
<Architect> place 1 purple block a little down to the left of the center
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> a little more toward the middle we need room to the right and left of it
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> left or right one
<Builder> which should i go with
<Architect> yeah looks good. lets go with right
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> ok then place 2 purple blocks to the right with 1 space in between the old and new ones
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> the right two should be connected, phrased that wrong
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> no prob
<Architect> nice now mirror that forward 1 space of whatever that is
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> it looks like it could be an animal kneeling
<Architect> next the body is red. let me get a good look at it
<Architect> its not quite a perfect cube. its 3x3x2 on top of those purple legs so the right most purple blocks should be sticking out the back
<Builder> what color?
<Architect> red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah like that
<Builder> damn we're nailin it
<Architect> its got an orange head not connected to the body and a blue tail that is connected. the head is to the right of where you are now

<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> lemme check it
<Builder> p majestic tbh
<Architect> think we did it
<Architect> we should name it
<Builder> im down
<Architect> looks like a ralph to me. ralph the rabbit
<Builder> im all in
<Architect> old yeller this fool

B25-A3-C78-1523385918318
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok this one is weird
<Architect> easy part is a big yellow arch. we'll start with that
<Builder> ok, where should i start?
<Architect> like 1 or 2 blocks to the left of center place 6 yellow blocks straight up
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah like that. then put 4 more across the top going to the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> sounds good
<Architect> need 2 more to go across the top
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> nice
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah like that
<Builder> ok, what else are we looking at?
<Architect> ok the rest of the figure uses red and orange blocks in a random pattern
<Builder> on the ground, on the arch, in the air, or both?
<Architect> we'll just go 1 at a time its pretty weird
<Builder> ok
<Architect> place the first red block on the inner left side of the arch, 1 space toward you
<Builder> i'll stay in a fixed position so it's easier to give me directions with respect to what i'm looking at
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> right sounds good. ok then place 1 to the right of that new red block
<Architect> yeah perfect
<Builder> another red block?
<Architect> yeah anothe rred
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> then 1 red on top of the right red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> then another red to the bottom right of the right ground red block. so its connected but diagonal on the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> same thing to the new red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4]
<Architect> then 1 more on the side toward you of that new red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> not diagonal though, just straight
<Builder> oh o
<Builder> ok*
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5]
<Architect> my bad
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-5]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-5]
<Builder> no problem
<Architect> ok thats it for red. now we do orange which all look to be in the air
<Architect> come around to the other side pls
<Architect> ok first orange block goes inside the arch connected to the topmost red block so that it comes toward you
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> then there are 2 more orange blocks that go diagonally the the left of that one while raising up in the air 1 space each time. so we need placeholders
<Builder> wait i think I got this
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yeah just like that. let me take a look and make sure it's all right
<Architect> awesome i think we did it
<Builder> is this ketchup and cheddar take mcdonalds or something
<Architect> could be
<Architect> golden arch :)
<Builder> next one?

B25-A3-C57-1523386572302
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok this one looks like a 4 and a weird 3 but they arent side by side and they are sort of interlinked
<Architect> you'll get what i mean later. lets start with the 4 because it's easy
<Architect> can start in the middle with 5 blue blocks straight up into the air
<Builder> to the left of the board?
<Architect> shouldn
<Architect> shouldnt matter
<Builder> ok
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok then one blue block to the right of the center and 2 blocks to the left of the center
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> need 1 more on top of the left block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:5 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:5 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok now the 3 is green. let me look where to start
<Builder> ok
<Architect> come around to the right so you are looking at the right side of the 4 please
<Architect> yeah there
<Architect> so place the first green on top of the little 4 arm
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> nice then one to the right of that piece
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> hmm not there. like to the right from where you were. the 3 isn
<Architect> isnt oriented the same, its tilted like 90 degreeds
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> degrees*
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> from where you are the next piece should go on the other side (forward)
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> no, those 2 new pieces aren't right yet. we need 1 block directly connected to that first green piece on the back side
<Architect> its hard to describe sorry
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> its not a traditional 3 either
<Builder> something like that?
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> or like that
<Architect> yeah there
<Builder> ok
<Architect> the piece not directly connected can be removed
[Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok then we need 1 green block right under the right green block
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> and one to the right of that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> then 2 straight down from that one
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and 1 to the left of that
[Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> there we go
<Builder> wow that is a funky 3
<Architect> i know right
<Architect> good job though

B25-A3-C21-1523387042769

<Architect> ok these looks like giant glasses with purple frames and red legs
<Architect> lets start with the purple frame
<Builder> ok
<Architect> we need 2 3x3 purple windows (with the center open) next to each other but with 1 space in between the squares. they should be upright

<Architect> yeah like that but only 4
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Builder> ok
<Builder> do they go down diagnonally?
<Architect> then if you can just stairstep it to the ground it should be done
<Architect> yes
<Builder> do I fill the lenses?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-3]

B25-A3-C10-1523387303809
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok this one goes across the whole space but is only 1 space in length i'd say
<Builder> ok
<Builder> what color blocks should I start with?
<Architect> lets go with yellow. find the true center of the board and place 1 yellow block to the left and right of center
<Architect> err
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah that looks good let me check
<Builder> I will zoom out for you
<Architect> ok i think thats good. then place 1 yellow block on top of the middle and remove the middle block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> its like arches within arches by the way
<Builder> should I just replicate this design
<Architect> it should be upright. my bad
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> the shapes aren't exactly the same
<Builder> oh ok
<Architect> ok place 1 purple block on top of the top yellow block and put 1 purple on either side of the center purple so its 3 in total

<Architect> need 5 red blocks in a row on top of the purple row
<Builder> ok, i'll just try and go for it
<Builder> let me know if I do it wrong
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0]

<Builder> lol

B25-A3-C26-1523387623272
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
<Architect> one second
<Builder> ok
<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
<Architect> should have specified
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> yeah there
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> just going to center it a bit
<Builder> my bad
<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> like that?
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
<Architect> yeah there
<Builder> ok
<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> close, just up to the left

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> ok nice
<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above

<Architect> okay, so this one is a little odd i think
<Builder> no problem, if it's hard to describe we can just go step by step
<Architect> so start by building an upright rectangle that is two block long and then 4 blocks high
<Architect> it should be blue
