	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap

	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?

	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?

	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long

	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?

	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?

	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap

	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?

	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> Yup,

	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> Yup,
	<Architect> Go ahead and extend it all the way to the point on the left.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> Yup,
	<Architect> Go ahead and extend it all the way to the point on the left.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> Yup,
	<Architect> Go ahead and extend it all the way to the point on the left.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> Yup,
	<Architect> Go ahead and extend it all the way to the point on the left.

	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> Yup,
	<Architect> Go ahead and extend it all the way to the point on the left.
	<Builder> there, or one more?

	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> Yup,
	<Architect> Go ahead and extend it all the way to the point on the left.
	<Builder> there, or one more?
	<Architect> Right there, add one block below the last red block you placed.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!

	<Architect> Right there, add one block below the last red block you placed.
	<Architect> And punch out the one right above it.

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Builder> ready!
	<Architect> ok, this ones really weird. Give me a second to try and figure it out.
	<Builder> no worries!
	<Architect> Ok, its going to be vertical.
	<Architect> we should try and make a sideways v on an edge. The point should be three blocks off the ground.
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purple
	<Builder> what to you mean by sideways?
	<Architect> Sorry, it hsould be purpleLike the red one.
	<Builder> like that but purple?
	<Architect> And the sides should go towards the center.
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Sorry, it should be perpendicular to the edge. It should have a side go to the ground and another going up above it
	<Builder> like that?
	<Builder> oh, crap
	<Builder> prependicular
	<Architect> Like that, except the side is one longer.
	<Architect> Sorry, shorter
	<Architect> not longer
	<Builder> so that?
	<Architect> But perpendicular
	<Builder> like this?
	<Architect> Sorry, the point of the v should on the edge.
	<Builder> the low point next to the red block, or the high one?
	<Architect> High point above it
	<Builder> should i shift the whole structure one tile towards me?
	<Builder> is that what you mean?
	<Architect> No, it would probably be easier to build a staircase that is 3 blocks tall towards an edge. Sorry I was to vague.
	<Builder> oh, wait, i think i see
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yeah, like that. The sides should just be one block shorter
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> and up against the edge, or right here?
	<Architect> Right there is good
	<Builder> ok, cool!
	<Builder> sorry about that
	<Architect> No worries, I was way too vague.
	<Architect> Can you punch out the two blocks on the bottom left?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Yup, and make the staircase going to your right from the top left block
	<Architect> It should just be two blocks long
	<Builder> like that, or one more?
	<Architect> One more, sorry.
	<Builder> got it!
	<Architect> Cool, now extend the bottom and top by 3 blocks
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Sorry, one more block
	<Builder> got it, no worries!
	<Architect> Cool, now add a side connecting the top and bottom
	<Builder> just a pillar, or mirroring the other side?
	<Architect> Ooh, like that except one to the right. Can you leave the top block there when you move it?
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> Perfect
	<Architect> Now we are going to add a blue square to the middle. It should touch the left of that block and the right of the v
	<Builder> those corners?
	<Architect> Yup
	<Builder> okay!
	<Architect> Cool, now replace the middle with a purple block and take out the top left corner
	<Builder> done!
	<Architect> Now, from the furthest right purple bock on the top, make a red block two above it
	<Builder> there?
	<Architect> Yup,
	<Architect> Go ahead and extend it all the way to the point on the left.
	<Builder> there, or one more?
	<Architect> Right there, add one block below the last red block you placed.
	<Architect> And punch out the one right above it.
	<Architect> Perfect! Sorry my instructions were bad.
