	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?

	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
	<Architect> one second
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
	<Architect> one second
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
	<Architect> one second
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above
	<Architect> yeah perfect
	<Builder> where does the red go?
	<Architect> its the same as green (3 pieces) but up and to the right a bit

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
	<Architect> one second
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above
	<Architect> yeah perfect
	<Builder> where does the red go?
	<Architect> its the same as green (3 pieces) but up and to the right a bit

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
	<Architect> one second
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above
	<Architect> yeah perfect
	<Builder> where does the red go?
	<Architect> its the same as green (3 pieces) but up and to the right a bit

	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above
	<Architect> yeah perfect
	<Builder> where does the red go?
	<Architect> its the same as green (3 pieces) but up and to the right a bit
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Builder> yay
	<Architect> third floor is purple with only 2 diagonal blocks

	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above
	<Architect> yeah perfect
	<Builder> where does the red go?
	<Architect> its the same as green (3 pieces) but up and to the right a bit
	<Architect> yeah like that

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
	<Architect> one second
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above
	<Architect> yeah perfect
	<Builder> where does the red go?
	<Architect> its the same as green (3 pieces) but up and to the right a bit
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Builder> yay
	<Architect> third floor is purple with only 2 diagonal blocks
	<Architect> its on the other side of the red so it sort of forms a corner
	<Builder> im going to assume for aesthetic purposes they go there
	<Builder> oh ok

	<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
	<Architect> one second
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above
	<Architect> yeah perfect
	<Builder> where does the red go?
	<Architect> its the same as green (3 pieces) but up and to the right a bit
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Builder> yay
	<Architect> third floor is purple with only 2 diagonal blocks

	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above
	<Architect> yeah perfect
	<Builder> where does the red go?
	<Architect> its the same as green (3 pieces) but up and to the right a bit
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Builder> yay
	<Architect> third floor is purple with only 2 diagonal blocks
	<Architect> its on the other side of the red so it sort of forms a corner
	<Builder> im going to assume for aesthetic purposes they go there
	<Builder> oh ok
	<Architect> i wish

	<Builder> Mission has started.
	<Architect> ok this one uses all the colors and is a weird shape
	<Architect> one second
	<Builder> ok
	<Architect> it should only take a 4x4 space on the ground with some piece removed but it extends up into the air
	<Builder> ok, do you want to do it level by level?
	<Builder> actually your call, you're the architect
	<Architect> sorry had a technical question. yeah we'll go 1 level at a time that sounds good
	<Architect> place 2 blue blocks diagonal from each other, that will be the bottom left of our figure
	<Architect> can you move the top one to the left side
	<Architect> should have specified
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> just going to center it a bit
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> no problem. then if you could place 1 yellow block 1 space away from the right blue block and make 3 diagonal pieces going the same direction that should be the first floor
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> whoops i forgot to clarify again. it should be to the right of the blue block
	<Architect> yeah there
	<Builder> ok
	<Builder> and then what are the 3 diagonal pieces?
	<Architect> then 3 more yellows going diagonally to the left like the blue
	<Architect> it kind of looks like a multi-floor rainbow for reference
	<Builder> like that?
	<Architect> close, just up to the left
	<Builder> my bad
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Architect> just 1 more yellow
	<Architect> ok nice
	<Architect> the second floor is green and red. lets start with green
	<Architect> it also goes in a diagonal and sort of fills the spaces between the blue and yellow, but above
	<Architect> yeah perfect
	<Builder> where does the red go?
	<Architect> its the same as green (3 pieces) but up and to the right a bit
	<Architect> yeah like that
	<Builder> yay
	<Architect> third floor is purple with only 2 diagonal blocks
	<Architect> its on the other side of the red so it sort of forms a corner
	<Builder> im going to assume for aesthetic purposes they go there
	<Builder> oh ok
	<Architect> i wish
	<Architect> last piece orange fills the corner on the 4th floor
	<Architect> there we go
	<Architect> good job builder :-)
	<Builder> what's a builder without an architect???
